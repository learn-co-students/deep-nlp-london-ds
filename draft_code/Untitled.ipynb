       "'Characters Woglinde (a Rhine daughter) - soprano Wellgunde (a Rhine daughter) - soprano Flosshilde (a Rhine daughter) - mezzo-soprano Alberich (king of the Nibelungs) - bass-baritone Fricka (goddess of marriage) - mezzo-soprano Wotan (ruler of the gods) - bass-baritone Freia (goddess of youth and beauty) - soprano Fasolt (a giant) - baritone Fafner (a giant, brother of Fasolt) - bass Froh (the fair god) - tenor Donner (god of thunder) - baritone Loge (half-god of fire) - tenor Mime (brother of Alberich) - tenor Erda (earth mother, goddess of wisdom) - contraltoPrelude and Scene One At the bottom of the Rhine (Greenish twilight, lighter above, darker below. The upper part of the scene is filled with moving water, which restlessly streams from right to left. Toward the bottom, the waters resolve themselves into a fine mist, so that the space, to a man\\'s height from the stage, seems free from the water, which floats like a train of clouds over the gloomy depths. Everywhere are steep points of rock jutting up from the depths and enclosing the whole stage; all the ground is broken up into a wild confusion of jagged pieces, so that there is no level place, while on all sides darkness indicates other deeper fissures.) (The curtain rises. Waters in motion. Woglinde circles with graceful swimming motions around the central rock.) Woglinde Weia! Waga! Wandering waters, swing ye our cradle! wagala weia! walala, weiala weia! Wellgunde (from above) Woglinde, watchest alone? Woglinde If Wellgunde came we were two.Wellgunde (dives down to the rock.) How safe is thy watch? Woglinde (eludes her by swimming) Safe from thy wiles! (They playfully chase one another.) Flosshilde (from above) Heiaha weia! heedless wild watchers! Wellgunde Flosshilde swim! Woglinde flies: help me to hinder her flying! (Flosshilde dives down between them.) Flosshilde The sleeping gold badly ye guard! Better beset the slumberer\\'s bed, or both will pay for your sport! (With merry cries they swim apart. Flosshilde tries to catch first one and then the other; they elude her and then together chase her and dart laughing and playing like fish between the rocks.) (From a dark chasm Alberich climbs up one of the rocks. He remains watching the water-maidens with increasing pleasure.)Alberich Hehe! ye nixies! (The maidens stop playing on hearing Alberich\\'s voice.) How ye delight me, daintiest folk! From Nibelheim\\'s night fain would I come, would ye turn but to me! Woglinde Hei! who is there? Wellgunde A voice in the dark. Flosshilde Look who is below! (They dive deeper down and see the Nibelung.) Woglinde, Wellgunde Fie! thou grisly one! Flosshilde (swimming quickly up) Look to the gold! Father warned us such foe to fear. (The two others follow her, and all three gather quickly around the middle rock.) Alberich You, above there! Rhine Daughters What wouldst thou below there? Alberich Spoil I your sport, if still I stand here and gaze? Dive ye but deeper, with you fain would a Nibelung dally and play.Woglinde Would he be our playmate? Wellgunde Doth he but mock? Alberich How bright and fair in the light ye shine! Fain are my arms to enfold a maiden so fair, would she come to me here! Flosshilde I laugh at my fear: the foe is in love! Wellgunde The languishing imp! Woglinde Let us go near him! (Woglinde lets herself sink to the top of the rock, the foot of which Alberich has reached.) Alberich One sinks down to me. Woglinde Come close to me here! (Alberich climbs with imp-like agility, but with frequent checks, to the top of the rock.) Alberich (hurriedly) Loathsome, slimy, slippery pebbles! I cannot stand! My hands and my feet cannot fasten or hold on the treacherous smoothness! Waterdrops fill up my nostrils ... accursed sneezing! (He has come near Woglinde.)Woglinde (laughing) Sneezing tells of my love\\'s approach! Alberich My sweetheart be, thou loveliest child! (He tries to embrace her.) Woglinde (avoiding him) Me wouldst thou woo? then woo me up here! (Alberich scratches his head. Woglinde has reached another rock.) Alberich Alas! thou escap\\'st? Come but nearer! Thou canst fly where I scarcely can creep. (Woglinde swims to a third rock, deeper down.) Woglinde Climb to the ground, then safe wouldst thou clasp me. Alberich (clambers hastily down) \\'Tis better down lower! Woglinde Now let us go higher!(She darts quickly to a high rock at the side) Wellgunde, Flosshilde (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Alberich How catch in her flight the timid fish? Wait a while, false one! (He tries to climb hastily after her.) (Wellgunde has sunk down to a lower rock on the other side.) Wellgunde Heia, thou fair one! hear\\'st thou me not? Alberich (turning around) Call\\'st thou to me? Wellgunde I counsel thee well: to me turn thee and Woglinde heed not! (Alberich clambers hastily over the ground to Wellgunde.) Alberich Far fairer seemest thou than that shy one, who gleams less brightly and looks too sleek. Yet deeper dive, if thou wouldst delight me. Wellgunde (letting herself sink down a little nearer to him) Now, am I not near? Alberich Not near enough! Thy slender arms come fling around me; that I may touch thee and toy with thy tresses, with passionate heat on thy bosom so soft let me press me!Wellgunde Art thou bewitched and longing for love-joys? then shew, thou fair one, what favor is thine! Fie! thou hairy and hideous imp! Swarthy, spotted and sulfury dwarf! Seek thee a sweetheart whom thou dost please! (Alberich tries to hold her by force.) Alberich Though foul be my face, my hands hold thee fast! Wellgunde (quickly swimming up to the middle rock) Hold fast, I flow from thy hands! Woglinde, Flosshilde (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Alberich (calling angrily after Wellgunde) Faithless thing! Bony, chilly-skinned fish! Seem I not comely, pretty and playful, brisk and bright? Hei! go wanton with eels then, if so loathsome am I!Flosshilde Why chid\\'st thou, elf? So soon cast down? But twain hast thou wooed: try but the third one, sweetest balm surely her love would bring! Alberich Soothing song comes to my ears! How good that ye are not but one: of many, some one I may win me; alone, no maiden would choose me! If I may trust thee, then glide down to me! Flosshilde (dives down to Alberich) How foolish are ye, senseless sisters, if ye find him not fair! Alberich (quickly approaching her) Both dull and hideous well may I deem them, now that the fairest I see! Flosshilde O sing still on thy soft sweet song, its charm enraptures mine ear! Alberich (confidently caressing her) My heart bounds and flutters and burns when such sweet praise laughs to me. Flosshilde (with gentle resistance) Thy winsome sweetness makes glad mine eyes, and thy tender smile all my spirit cheers! (She draws him tenderly to her.) Dearest of men! Alberich Sweetest of maids! Flosshilde Wert thou but mine!Alberich Might I e\\'er hold thee! Flosshilde (ardently) O, the sting of thy glance and the prick of thy beard, for ever to see and to feel! Might the locks of thy hair, so shaggy and sharp, but float round Flosshilde ever! and thy shape like a toad, and the croak of thy voice, o might I, dazzled and dumb, see and hear nothing but these! (Woglinde and Wellgunde have dived down close to them.) Woglinde, Wellgunde (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Alberich (starting up, alarmed) Wretches, laugh ye at me? Flosshilde (suddenly darting from him) As fits at the end of the song! (She swims quickly up with her sisters.)Woglinde, Wellgunde (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Alberich (in a wailing voice) Woe\\'s me! ah, woe\\'s me! alas! alas! The third one, so dear, doth she too betray? Ye shameless, shifting, worthless and infamous wantons! Feed ye on falsehood, treacherous watery brood? Rhine Daughters Wallala! Wallala! lalaleia! leialalei! heia! heia! ha ha! Shame on thee, imp! why chid\\'st thou down yonder? Hear the words that we sing thee! Say wherefore, faint-heart, didst thou not hold the maiden thou dost love? True are we, free from all guile, to him who holds us fast. Gaily to work, and grasp without fear; in the floods not fleet is our flight: Wallala! lalaleia! leialalei! heia! heia! ha hei! (They swim apart, hither and thither, now deeper, now higher, to incite Alberich to chase them.)Alberich Through all my frame what passionate fire now burns and glows! Rage and longing, fierce and mighty, lash me to madness! Though ye may laugh and lie, yearning masters my heart, and one to me now shall yield her! (He begins the chase with desperate exertions. With terrible agility he climbs the rocks, springs from one to the other, and tries to catch first one then another of the maidens, who always elude him with mocking laughter.) (He staggers and falls into the abyss, then clambers hastily aloft again to renew the chase.) (They let themselves sink a little. He almost reaches them, falls back again, and again tries to catch them.) (Foaming with rage, he pauses breathless and stretches his clenched fist up toward the maidens.) Alberich Could I but capture one! (He remains in speechless rage gazing upward, when suddenly he is attracted and chained by the following spectacle.) (Through the water from above breaks a con- tinuously brightening glow, which, on a high point of the middle rock, kindles to a blinding, brightly shining gleam; a magical light streams from this through the water.)Woglinde Look, sisters! The wakener laughs to the deep. Wellgunde Through the waters green the radiant sleeper he greets. Flosshilde He kisses her eyelids, so to unclose them. Wellgunde Look, she smiles in the shining light. Woglinde Through the floods afar flows her glittering ray! Rhine Daughters (together swimming around the rock) Heia jaheia! heia jaheia! Wallala la la la leia jahei! Rhine-gold, Rhine-gold! Radiant joy, thou laughest in glorious light! Glistening beams thy splendor shoots forth o\\'er the waves! Heia jahei! heia jaheia! Waken friend! wake in joy! Games will we play so gladly with thee: flasheth the foam, flameth the flood, as, floating around, with dancing and singing, we joyously dive to thy bed! Rhine-gold! Rhine-gold! heia jaheia! heia jaheia! Wallala la la la heia jahei! (With ever-increasing mirth the maidens swim around the rock. All the water gleams with golden light.)Alberich (whose eyes, strongly attracted by the gleam, are fixed on the gold) What is\\'t, ye sleek ones, that there doth gleam and glow? Rhine Daughters Where hast thou, churl, ever dwelt, of the Rhine-gold ne\\'er to have heard? Wellgunde Knows not the elf of the gold\\'s bright eye, then, that wakes and sleeps in turn? Woglinde Of the wondrous star in watery deeps, whose glory lightens the waves? Rhine Daughters See how blithely we glide in its radiance! wouldst thou, faint-heart, then bathe in brightness, come float and frolic with us! Wallala la la leia lalai! Wallala la la leia jahei!Alberich For your water games is the gold alone good? Then nought would it boot me! Woglinde The golden charm wouldst thou not flout, knewest thou all of its wonders. Wellgunde The world\\'s wealth would be won by the man who, out of the Rhine-gold, fashioned the ring which measureless might would bestow. Flosshilde Our father said it, and bade us ever guard with wisdom the shining hoard, that no false one should craftily steal it: then peace, ye chattering brood! Wellgunde Most prudent sister, why chidest thou so? Well knowest thou, only by one the golden charm may be wrought? Woglinde He who the sway of love forswears, he who delight of love forbears, alone the magic can master that forces the gold to a ring. Wellgunde Secure then are we and free from care, for all that liveth loveth; none from love\\'s fetters would free him. Woglinde And least of all he, the languishing dwarf with love-desire wasting away.Flosshilde I fear him not, whom here we have found: in his passion\\'s blaze nearly I burned. Wellgunde A sulfur brand in the water\\'s surge, in lover\\'s frenzy hissing loud! Rhine Daughters Wallala! Wallaleia la la! Loveliest Niblung! laugh\\'st thou not too? In the golden shimmer how fair thou dost shine! O come, lovely one, laugh thou with us! Heia jaheia! heia jaheia! Wallala la la la leia jahei! (They swim, laughing, to and fro in the light.) (Alberich, with his eyes fixed on the gold, has listened well to the sisters\\' hasty chatter.) Alberich The world\\'s wealth by thy spell might I win for mine own? If love be denied me, my cunning shall win me delight? (terribly loud) Mock ye then on! the Niblung neareth your toy. (Raging he springs to the middle rock and clambers with terrible haste to its summit. The maidens separate screaming and swim upward on different sides.)Rhine Daughters Heia! heia! heia jahei! Save yourselves! The elf is distraught; how the water swirls where\\'er he swims: for love has lost him his wits! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! (With a last spring, Alberich reaches the summit.) Alberich Fear ye not yet? Then wanton in darkness, watery brood! (He stretches his hand out toward the gold.) My hand quenches your light, I wrest from the rock the gold, fashion the ring of revenge; for hear me ye floods: love henceforth be accursed! (He tears the gold from the rock with terrible force and plunges with it hastily into the depth, where he quickly disappears. Thick darkness falls suddenly on the scene. The maidens dive down after the robber.) Flosshilde Seize on the spoiler! Wellgunde Rescue the gold! Rhine Daughters Help us! Help us! Woe! Woe! (The water sinks down with them. From the lowest depth is heard Alberich\\'s shrill, mocking laughter.) (The rocks disappear in thickest darkness, and the whole stage is from top to bottom filled with black water waves, which for some time seem to sink downward.) (The waves have gradually changed into clouds, which little by little become lighter, and at length disperse into a fine mist.) (As the mist disappears upward in little clouds, an open space on a mountain height becomes visible in the twilight. At one side, on a flowery bank, lies Wotan with Fricka near him, both asleep.)Scene Two An open space on a mountain height (The dawning day lights up with growing bright- ness a castle with glittering pinnacles, which stands on the top of a cliff in the background. Between this cliff and the foreground, a deep valley through which the Rhine flows is supposed. Wotan and Fricka asleep.) (The castle has become quite visible. Fricka awakes: her gaze falls on the castle.)Fricka (alarmed) Wotan, give ear! awaken! Wotan (dreaming) The sacred dwelling of joy is guarded by gate and door: Manhood\\'s honor, might without bound, rise now to endless renown! Fricka (shakes him) Up from thy vision\\'s blissful deceit! My husband, wake and bethink thee! (Wotan awakes and raises himself a little. His eyes are at once fixed by the view of the castle.) Wotan Achieved the eternal work! On mountain summit the gods\\' abode! proudly stand the glittering walls! As in dreams \\'twas designed, as by will \\'twas decreed, strong and fair stands it in sight: hallowed glorious pile! Fricka What thee delighteth brings me but dread! Thou hast thy joy, my fear is for Freia! Heedless one, dost thou remember the truly promised reward? The work is finished and forfeit the pledge: forgettest thou what thou must pay?Wotan I mind me well of the bargain they made who raised me the walls; by a bond bound were the rebels in thrall, that they this hallowed dwelling might build me; it stands now—thank the workers: for the wage fret not thyself. Fricka O laughing impious lightness! loveless, cold-hearted folly! Had I but known of thy pact, the trick I then had withstood; but ever ye men kept afar from the women, that, deaf to us and in peace, alone ye might deal with the giants: so without shame ye base ones abandoned Freia, my loveliest sister, pleased right well with your pact! What to your hard hearts is holy and good, when ye men lust for might? Wotan (quietly) Was like greed to Fricka unknown, when she for the building did beg?Fricka For my husband\\'s truth aye in care with sorrow must I ponder, how to hold him beside me, lured by his fancy afar: halls fair and stately, joys of the homestead, surely should bind thee in peaceful repose. But thou in this work hast dreamed of war and arms alone: glory and might ever to win thee, and ne\\'er-ending strife to enkindle, were builded the towering walls. Wotan (smiling) Wouldst thou, o wife, in the fortress then fix me, to me, the God, must be granted that, in the castle prisoned, yet from outside I must win me the world: ranging and changing love all who live; forgo that game, then, I cannot! Fricka Cold, unloving, pitiless heart! For the vain delights of power and sway, thou stakest in insolent scorn love and a woman\\'s worth? Wotan When I for wife sought to win thee, an eye, as forfeit, placed I wooing in pledge: how vainly now dost thou chide! Women I worship e\\'en more than thou wouldst; and Freia, the fair one, will I not grant; in truth, such thought ne\\'er was mine.Fricka (looking anxiously off the stage) Then shelter her now: defenseless, in fear, hither she hastens for help. (Freia enters, as if in hasty flight.) Freia Help me, sister! shelter me, brother! From yonder mountain threatened me Fasolt; he comes now hither to take me. Wotan Let him threat! Saw\\'st thou not Loge? Fricka That thou still on the trickster bestowest thy trust! Much wrong he ever has wrought, yet aye again he ensnares thee. Wotan Where simple truth serves, alone I seek no helper. But, to force the spite of foes to serve me, guile and cunning alone, as Loge has learned them, can teach. He who this treaty designed gave promise Freia to ransom: on him I fix now my faith.Fricka And he leaves thee alone! There stride the giants hither in haste: where lurks thy crafty ally? Freia Where linger then my brothers, when help they should bring me, now that Wotan abandons the weak! O help me, Donner! Hither, hither! Rescue Freia, my Froh! Fricka The disgraceful band who betrayed thee, have all now hidden away! (Fasolt and Fafner, both of gigantic stature, armed with strong clubs, enter.) Fasolt Soft sleep closed thine eyes; the while we twain unslumb\\'ring built the walls. Mighty toil tired us not, heavy stones we heaped on high; lofty tower, gate and door guard and keep thy castle halls secure. (pointing to the castle) There stands what we builded, shining bright in daylight\\'s beams: wend ye in, pay us our wage! Wotan Name, workers, your wage; what deems ye fitting guerdon? Fasolt The price was fixed, as fit it was deemed; is all so soon forgot? Freia, the fair one, Holda, the free one, the bargain holds, we bear her with us.Wotan (quickly) Has then your bargain blinded your wits? Other guerdon ask: Freia may I not grant! (For a moment Fasolt stands speechless with angry astonishment.) Fasolt What say\\'st thou? ha! Traitor art thou? thy treaty a trick? What thy spear wards serves but for sport, all the runes of weighty bargains? Fafner My trusty brother, seest thou, fool, now his guile? Fasolt Son of light, light of spirit! hear and heed thyself; in treaties aye keep troth! What thou art, art thou only by treaties; by bargains bound, bounded too is thy might: art wiser thou than wary are we, pledged are we freemen in peace to thee: cursed be all thy wisdom, peace be no more between us, if, no more open, honest and free, in bargains thou breakest thy faith! A foolish giant gives this rede: thou wise one, learn it from him!Wotan How sly to take in earnest what but in sport we have spoken! The loveliest goddess, light and bright, what boots you dullards her grace? Fasolt Mock\\'st thou us? ha, how unjust! Ye who by beauty reign, hallowed radiant race, how vainly strive ye for towers of stone, place for court and hall woman\\'s beauty in pledge! We dullards plague ourselves, sweating with toil-hardened hands to win us a woman, who, winsome and sweet, should dwell aye among us: and the pact call\\'st thou a jest? Fafner Cease thy foolish chatter; no gain look we to win: Freia\\'s charms help little, but much it boots from \\'mongst the gods now to wrest her. (softly) Golden apples ripen within her garden, she alone knoweth how they are tended; the gardens\\' fruit grants to her kindred, each day renewed, youth ever-lasting: pale and blighted passeth their beauty, old and weak waste they away, if e\\'er Freia should fail them., (roughly) From their midst let us bear her away!Wotan (to himself) Loge lingers long! Fasolt Straight speak now thy word! Wotan Ask for other wage! Fasolt No other, Freia alone! Fafner Thou, there! follow us! (Fafner and Fasolt press toward Freia. Froh and Donner enter in haste.) Freia Help! Help from the hard ones! Froh (clasping Freia in his arms) To me, Freia! (to Fafner) Back from her, miscreant! Froh shields the fair one! Donner (planting himself before the two giants) Fasolt and Fafner, know ye the weight of my hammer\\'s heavy blow? Fafner What means thy threat? Fasolt Why com\\'st thou here? Strife have we not sought, nought ask we now but our wage.Donner Full oft paid I, giants, your wage. Approach, and take your due, weighed with a generous hand. (He swings his hammer.) Wotan (stretching out his spear between the disputants) Hold, thou fierce one! Nought booteth force! All bonds the shaft of my spear doth shield: spare then thy hammer\\'s haft! Freia Woe\\'s me! Woe\\'s me! Wotan forsakes me! Fricka Is this thy resolve, merciless heart? (Wotan turns away and sees Loge coming.) Wotan There is Loge! Such is thy haste bargains to mend that were struck by thy evil counsel? (Loge has come up out of the valley.) Loge How? what bargain have I then counseled? Belike \\'twas the pact that ye with the giants did make? To hollow and height my whim drives me on; house and hearth delight me not. Donner and Froh are dreaming of household joys; if they would wed, a home e\\'en must they find. A proud abode, a castle sure, thereto leaned Wotan\\'s wish. House and hall, court and keep, the blessed abode now standeth firmly built. The lordly pile I proved myself, if all be firm, well have I tried; Fasolt and Fafner faithful I found: no stone stirs on its bed. Not idle was I like many here; who calls me laggard, he lies.Wotan Craftily wouldst thou escape? If thou betray me, truly I bid thee beware! Of all the gods, as thy only friend, I took thee up, \\'mid the troop who trusted thee not. Now speak and counsel well. When as the builders did crave from us Freia as guerdon, thou know\\' st, I only yielded my word when, on thy faith, thou didst promise to ransom the hallowed pledge? Loge With greatest pains thereon to ponder, how we might free her, that promise I gave. But there to prosper where nought will fit and nought will serve could e\\'er such promise be given?Fricka (to Wotan) See what traitorous knave thou didst trust! Froh Loge art thou, but liar I call thee! Donner Accursed flame, I will quench thy glow! Loge Their disgrace to cover, fools now revile me! (Donner threatens to strike Loge.) Wotan (steps between them) In quiet leave now my friend! Ye know not Loge\\'s craft: richer count I his counsel\\'s worth, when \\'tis haltingly paid. Fafner Halt no longer! Promptly pay! Fasolt Long waiteth our wage! (Wotan turns sharply to Loge.) Wotan (urgently) Now hear, crabbed one! keep thy word! Say truly, where hast thou strayed?Loge Thankless was ever Loge\\'s toil! In care but for thee, looked I around, and restlessly searched to the ends of the world: to find a ransom for Freia, fit for the giants and fair. In vain sought I, and see now full well: in the world\\'s wide ring nought is so rich that a man will take it as price for woman\\'s worth and delight! (All show astonishment and perplexity.) Where life ever is moving, in water, earth and air, much sought I, asking of all men, where force doth but stir, and life hath beginning: what among men more mighty seems, than woman\\'s worth and delight? But where life ever is moving, still scorned alone was my questioning craft: in water, earth and air, none will forgo the joy of love. (Varied excitement.) But one I looked on, who love\\'s delights forswore, for ruddy gold renouncing all woman\\'s grace. The Rhine\\'s fair winsome children told to me all their woe:the Nibelung, Night-alberich, seeking in vain grace from the swimmers to win; the Rhine-gold the robber then stole in revenge: he deems it now the holiest good, greater than woman\\'s grace. For the glittering dross, so reft from the deep, resounded the maidens\\' wailing: to thee, Wotan, turning their prayers, that thy vengeance fall on the Niblung, (with growing warmth) the gold they pray thee now to give them to shine in the water forever. This to tell thee I promised the maidens: and now has Loge kept faith. Wotan Foolish art thou, if not e\\'en knavish! Myself seest thou in need: what help for others have I? Fasolt (who has listened attentively, to Fafner) The gold I begrudge the Niblung; much ill he ever has wrought us, but slyly still the dwarf has slipped away from our hands. Fafner Still the Niblung broods on new ill if gold but grant him power. Listen, Loge! say without lie: what glory lies in the gold which the Niblung holds so dear?Loge A toy \\'tis in the waters sleeping, serving for children\\'s delight; but if to a rounded ring it be fashioned, measureless might it grants, and wins the world for its lord. Wotan (thoughtfully) Rumors came to me of the Rhine-gold: runes of booty hide in its ruddy glow; might and wealth unmeasured a ring would gain. Fricka (softly to Loge) Serves as well the golden trinket\\'s glittering dross to deck forth a woman\\'s grace? Loge Her husband\\'s faith were fixed by the wife who ever bore the glist\\'ning charm that busy dwarves are forging toiling in thrall to the ring. Fricka (caressingly to Wotan) O, might but my husband win him the gold?Wotan (appearing more and more under the influence of a spell) Methinks it were wise now sway o\\'er the ring to ensure me. But say, Loge, what is the art by which the trinket is shaped? Loge A rune of magic makes the gold a ring; no one knows it; but he can use the spell who blessed love forswears. (Wotan turns away in ill-humor.) That likes thee not; too late, too, cam\\'st thou. Alberich did not delay. Fearless the might of the spell he won; (harsh) and rightly wrought was the ring! Donner (to Wotan) Slaves should we be all to the dwarf, were not the ring from him wrested. Wotan The ring I must win me! Froh Lightly now without curse of love were it won. Loge (harshly) Right well, without art, as in children\\'s play! Wotan Then counsel, how?Loge By theft! What a thief stole, steal thou from the thief: couldst better gain aught for thine own? But with weapons dire fighteth Alberich; deep and shrewd must be thy working, if the thief thou wouldst o\\'er-reach, so that thou may st render the ruddy dross, the gold (with warmth) once more to the maidens, for therefor pray they to thee. Wotan The river maidens? What boots me that rede? Fricka Of the watery brood let nought be spoken; to my distress, many a man they lured to their watery lair. (Wotan stands silently struggling with himself. The other gods fix their eyes on him in mute suspense. Meanwhile Fafner has been conferring aside with Fasolt.) Fafner (to Fasolt) Trust me, more than Freia boots the glittering gold: eternal youth would be won if the golden charm were our own. (Fasolt\\'s demeanor shows that he feels himself >convinced against his will. Fafner and Fasolt approach Wotan again.)Fafner Hear, Wotan, our word as we wait! Free with you leave we Freia; guerdon less great shall content us: for us rude giants enough were Nibelheim\\'s ruddy gold. Wotan Are ye distraught? What is not mine own, how can I, ye shameless ones, grant you? Fafner Hard labor built yonder walls: light were\\'t for thy cunning and force (what our spite e\\'er failed to achieve:) to fetter the Niblung fast. Wotan (quickening) For you shall I deal with the Niblung? for you fetter the foe? Insolent and greedy, ye dullards, are ye made by my debt! (Fasolt suddenly seizes Freia and draws her with Fafner to the side.) Fasolt To us, maid! We claim thee now! As pledge stay thou with us till thy ransom be paid! Freia (screaming) Woe\\'s me! Woe\\'s me! Woe!Fafner Far from here let her be borne! Till evening, heed me well! held is she as a pledge; at night return we; but when we come, if at hand lie not the ransom, the Rhine-gold fair and red. Fasolt At end is her shrift then, Freia is forfeit: forever dwell she with us! Freia (screaming) Sister, Brothers! Save me! Help! (Freia is borne away by the hastily retreating giants.) Froh Up, to her aid! Donner Perish then, all things! (They look at Wotan enquiringly.) Freia (in the distance) Save me! Help! Loge (looking after the giants) Over stock and stone they stride down to the vale: through the water heavily wade now the giants. Sad at heart hangs Freia, so roughly borne on their shoulders! Heia! hei! the churls, how they lumber along!Now they tramp up through the vale. First at Riesenheim\\'s bound their rest will they take. (He turns to the gods.) How darkly Wotan doth brood? Alack, what aileth the gods? (A pale mist fills the stage, gradually growing denser. In it the gods\\' appearance becomes in creas- ingly wan and aged. All stand in dismay and expec- tation looking at Wotan, who fixes his eyes on the ground in thought.) Mists, do ye trick me? Mocks me a dream? Dismayed and wan ye wither so soon! From your cheeks the bloom dies out; and quenched is the light of your eyes! Courage, Froh! day is at dawn! From thy hand, Donner, escapeth the hammer! What grief hath Fricka? Is she in sorrow for Wotan, gloomy and grey, who seems already grown old? Fricka Woe\\'s me! Woe\\'s me! What has befall\\'n? Donner My hand doth sink! Froh My heart stands still!Loge I see now! hear what ye lack! Of Freia\\'s fruit not yet have ye eaten today. The golden apples that grow in her garden, have made you all doughty and young, ate ye them day by day. The garden\\'s keeper in pledge now is granted; on the branches droops and dies the fruit, decayed soon it will fall. It irks me little; for meanly ever Freia to me stinted the sweet-tasting fruit: but half as godlike am I, ye great ones, as you! (freely, but quickly and harshly) But ye set your fortune on the youth-giving fruit: that wotted the giants well; and at your lives this blow now is aimed: to save them be your care! Lacking the apples, old and grey, worn and weary, withered, the scoff of the world, dies out the godly race. Fricka (anxiously) Wotan, my lord! unhappy man! See how thy laughing lightness has brought us all disgrace and shame! Wotan (starting up with a sudden resolve) Up, Loge! descend with me! To Nibelheim go we together: for I will win me the gold.Loge The Rhine daughters called upon thee: ah, may they then hope for a hearing? Wotan (violently) Peace, thou babbler, Freia, the fair one, Freia needs must be ransomed! Loge At thy command, swiftly we go: down the steeps shall we make way through the Rhine? Wotan Not through the Rhine! Loge Then swing we ourselves through the sulfur-cleft: down yonder slip in with me! (He goes first and disappears at the side in a cleft, from which, immediately afterward, a sulfurous vapor arises.) Wotan Ye others wait till evening here: the golden ransom, to win back our youth will I gain! (He descends after Loge into the cleft. The sulfurous vapor issuing therefrom spreads over the whole stage and quickly fills it with thick clouds. Those remaining on it are soon hidden.)Donner Fare thee well, Wotan! Froh Good luck! Good luck! Fricka O soon return to thy sorrowing wife! (The vapor thickens to a quite black cloud, which rises from below upward; this then changes to a dark, rocky chasm, which continues to rise so that the theater seems to be gradually sinking into the earth.) (A ruddy glow shines from various places in the distance, increasing clamor, as from smithing, is heard on all sides.) (The clang of the anvils dies away. A subterranean chasm appears, which fills the whole scene and seems to open into narrow clefts on all sides.)Scene Three Nibelheim (Alberich drags the shrieking Mime from a side cleft.) Alberich Hehe! hehe! to me! to me! mischievous imp! Prettily pinched, now shalt thou be, if in a trice, thou forgest me not the work as I did command. Mime (howling) Ohe! Ohe! Au! Au! Let me alone! Forged it is, as thou did\\'st bid, with moil and toil all is now done: take but thy (shrilly) nails from my ear! Alberich Why waitest thou then, and shew\\'st it not? Mime I only faltered lest aught were failing. Alberich What then was not finished? Mime (embarrassed) Here ... and there ...Alberich What here and there? Give me the thing! (He tries to catch his ear again. Mime, in his terror, lets fall a piece of metal work which he held con- vulsively in his hand. Alberich picks it up quickly and examines it carefully.) See, thou rogue! All has been forged as I gave my command, finished and fit. Ah, would then the dolt cunningly trick me? and keep the wonderful work for himself, that which my craft alone taught him to forge? Known art thou, foolish thief? (He places the Tarnhelm on his head.) The helm fitteth the head: now will the spell also speed? (very softly) \"Night and darkness. Nowhere seen!\" (His form vanishes; in its place a column of mist is seen.) Seest thou me, brother? Mime (looks about him in astonishment) Where art thou? I see thee not. Alberich (invisible) Then feel me instead, thou lazy rogue! Take that for thy thievish thought! (Mime writhes under the blows he receives, whose sound is heard without the scourge being seen.) Mime Ohe! Ohe! Au! Au! Au!Alberich (laughing, invisible) Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I thank thee, blockhead, thy work is true and fit! Hoho! Hoho! Nibelungs all, bow ye to Alberich! Everywhere over you waits he and watches; peace and rest now have departed; aye must ye serve him, unseen though he be; unaware he is nigh ye still shall await him! Thrall to him are ye forever! (harshly) Hoho! Hoho! hear him, he nears: the Nibelungs\\' lord! (The column of vapor disappears in the back- ground. The sounds of Alberich\\'s scolding become fainter in the distance. Mime cowers down in pain.) (Wotan and Loge come down from a cleft in the rock.) Loge Nibelheim here. Through pallid vapors there glisten bright sparks from the smithies. Mime Au! Au! Au! Wotan One groans aloud: what lies on the ground? Loge (bends over Mime) Say, wherefore moanest thou here? Mime Ohe! Ohe! Au! Au! Loge Hei, Mime! merry dwarf! What plagues and pinches thee so? Mime Leave me in quiet!Loge That will I surely, and more yet, hark! help I promise thee, Mime. (He raises him with difficulty to his feet.) Mime What help for me! I must obey the behests of my brother, who makes me bondsman to him. Loge But, Mime, to bind thee, what gave him the power? Mime By evil craft molded Alberich, from yellow gold of the Rhine, a ring: at its mighty spell we tremble in wonder; by that now he enthralls us, the Nibelungs\\' darksome host. Blithely we smiths once worked at our anvils, forged for our women trinkets so fair, delicate Nibelung toys: we lightly laughed at our toil. The wretch now compels us to creep into caverns, for him alone we ever must toil. Through the ring of gold his greed still descries where\\'er new treasure lies hid in the clefts: there must we all seek it, trace it and dig it, to melt the booty, to forge him the gold, with no peace nor rest for him to heap up the hoard. Loge Just now, then, an idler wakened his ire!Mime Poor Mime, ah! my fate was the hardest. A helm of mail had I to forge him; with care he gave commands for its making. My wit conceived the mighty power that lay in the work I had forged of steel; the helm I fain had held for my own; to use the spell to free me from Alberich\\'s sway: perchance ... yes, perchance, the tyrant himself to o\\'ermaster, and place him by guile in my power; the ring then had I ravished, that, as a slave now I serve him, (harshly) in thrall he should then be to me! Loge And wherefore, wise one, didst thou not thrive? Mime Ah! though the work I fashioned, the magic that lurks therein, the magic I guessed not aright: he who planned the work which then he seized, he taught me, alas, but now all too late, what a spell lay in the helm. From my sight he vanished; but, lurking unseen, sharp strokes he showered on me. (crying and sobbing) Such pay for my pains I, fool, did win. (He rubs his back. Wotan and Loge laugh.)Loge (to Wotan) Confess, not light will be our task. Wotan But the foe will fall, if thou but help! (Mime observes the gods more attentively.) Mime What mean all your questions? Who are ye then, strangers? Loge Friends to thee; from all their need the Niblungen folk we shall free! (Mime, on hearing Alberich\\'s approach, shrinks back frightened.) Mime Look to yourselves; Alberich nears. (He runs to and fro in terror.) Wotan (seating himself quietly on a stone) We wait for him here. (Alberich, who has removed the Tarnhelm from his head and hung it on his girdle, drives before him, with brandished whip, a host of Nibelungs from the caverns below. They are laden with gold and silver handiwork, which, under Alberich\\'s continuous abuse and scolding, they heap together so as to form a large pile.)Alberich Hither! Thither! Hehe! Hoho! Lazy herd! There in a heap pile up the hoard! Thou there, go up! Wilt thou get on? Indolent folk! Down with the treasure! Shall I then help you? Here with it all! (He suddenly perceives Wotan and Loge.) Hey! who is there? What guests are these? Mime, to me! Pestilent wretch! Pratest thou here with the vagabond pair? Off, thou sluggard! Back to thy smelting and smithing! (He drives Mime with blows of his whip into the crowd of Nibelungs.) Hey! to your labor! Get ye hence straight-way! Quickly below! From the new-made shafts go get me the gold! Who slowly digs shall suffer the whip! That no one be idle, Mime be surety, or scarce shall he scape from my scourge\\'s lashes! That I ev\\'rywhere wander when no one is ware, that wots he; think I full well! Linger ye still? Loiter ye then? (He draws his ring from his finger, kisses it and stretches it out threateningly.) Tremble in terror, ye vanquished host! All obey the ring\\'s great lord! (With howls and shrieks the Nibelungs, among whom is Mime, separate and slip into different clefts in all directions.) (Alberich looks long and suspiciously at Wotan and Loge.) What seek ye here?Wotan Of Nibelheim\\'s darksome land strange tidings have reached our ears: great the wonders worked here by Alberich; on these now to feast us, greed has made us they guests. Alberich Led hither by envy ye came: such gallant guests, believe, well I know! Loge Know\\'st thou me well, ignorant imp? Then say, who am I? why dost so bark? In chilly caves when crouching thou lay\\'st, where were thy light and comforting fire then, had Loge not on thee laughed? What boots thee thy forging, be not thy forge lit by me? Kin to thee am I, and once was kind: not warm, methinks, are thy thanks!Alberich On light-elves laughs now Loge, the crafty rogue? Art thou, false one, their friend, as my friend once thou wert: haha! I laugh! from them, then, nought need I fear. Loge Methinks, then, me may\\'st thou trust. Alberich In thy untruth trust I, not in thy truth! (taking a defiant attitude) Undismayed now I defy you. Loge Courage high thy might doth confer; grimly great waxes thy power! Alberich Seest thou the hoard, by my host heaped for me there? Loge A goodlier never was seen. Alberich It is today but scanty measure! Proud and mighty shall the hoard be hereafter. Wotan But what can boot thee the hoard, in joyless Nibelheim, where treasure nothing can buy?Alberich Treasure to gather, and treasure to bury, serves me Nibelheim\\'s night. But with the hoard, that in caverns I hide, shall wonders be worked by the Niblung; and by its might the world as my own I shall win me! Wotan How beginn\\'st thou that, then, good friend? Alberich Lapped in gently wafting breezes ye who now live, laugh and love: with golden grasp, ye godly ones all shall be captured! As love by me was once forsworn, All that have life shall eke forswear it! Enchanted by gold, the greed for gold shall enslave you! On glorious heights abide ye in gladness, rocked in bliss; the dark elves ye disdain in your revels eternal! Beware! Beware! For first your men shall bow to my might, then your winsome women, who my wooing despised, shall yield to Alberich\\'s force, though love be his foe! (laughing savagely) Ha ha ha ha! Hear ye my word? Beware! Beware! of the hosts of the night, when rises the Niblung hoard from silent deeps to the day!Wotan (violently) Away, impious wretch! Alberich What says he? Loge (stepping between them) Lose not thy senses! (to Alberich) Who were not seized with wonder, beholding Alberich\\'s work? If only thy craft can achieve all thou dost hope of the treasure: the mightiest then must I call thee, for moon and stars and the sun in his splendor, could not then withstand thy power, they too must be thy slaves. Yet ... well \\'twould seem before all things that the host of the Niblungs, who heap up thy hoard, should serve thee free from spite. When thy hand held forth a ring; then trembling cowered thy folk: but in they sleep a thief might slink by and steal slyly the ring. How, crafty one, then wouldst thou speed?Alberich The deepest one Loge deems him; others takes he ever for fools: that e\\'er I should need him, and dearly pay for word and aid, that fain would the thief now hear! This covering helm myself I conceived; the cunningest smith, Mime, forced I to forge it: swiftly to change me, into all shapes at my will to transform me, serves the helm. None can see me, though he may seek; yet ev\\'rywhere am I, though hidden from sight. So, free from care, not even thy craft need I fear, thou kind, provident friend! Loge Many wonders oft have I looked on, but such a marvel ne\\'er met my eyes. This work without equal none would believe in; couldst thou but work this wonder, thy might then were unending! Alberich Think\\'st thou I lie and boast me like Loge?Loge Till it is proved, I trust not, dwarf, thy word. Alberich Art puffed up with prudence, fool, well nigh to bursting! Then envy me now! Command, and say in what shape I shall presently stand? Loge Be shaped as thou wilt; but make me dumb with amaze! Alberich (puts the Tarnhelm on his head) \"Dragon dread, wind thee and coil thee!\" (He immediately disappears. In his place a huge serpent writhes on the floor; it lifts its head and stretches its open jaws toward Wotan and Loge.) Loge (pretends to be seized with terror) Ohe! Ohe! Terrible dragon, oh, swallow me not! Spare his life but to Loge! Wotan (laughing) Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Good, Alberich! Good, thou rascal! How quickly grew the dwarf to the dragon so dread! (The dragon disappears and immediately Alberich is seen in his place.) Alberich Hehe! ye doubters! trust ye me now?Loge (in a trembling voice) My trembling truly may prove it! A giant snake thou straight didst become: now I have seen, surely must I believe it. But, as thou grewest, canst also shape thee quite small and slender? The shrewdest way were that, methinks, all danger to escape: that, truly, would be too hard. Alberich Too hard for thee, dull as thou art! How small shall I be? Loge That the smallest cranny could hold thee, where a frightened toad might be hid. Alberich Pah! nought simpler! Look at me now! (He puts on the Tarnhelm again.) \"Crooked toad, creep thou hither!\" (He disappears. The gods perceive a toad on the rocks, crawling toward them.) Loge (to Wotan) There, grasp quickly! Capture the toad! (Wotan places his foot on the toad. Loge makes for his head and holds the Tarnhelm in his hand. Alberich becomes suddenly visible in his own form, writhing under Wotan\\'s foot.)Alberich Ohe! Accurst! Now am I captive! Loge Hold him fast till he is bound. (Loge binds his hands and feet with a rope.) Now swiftly up: there he is ours! (Both seize the prisoner, who struggles violently, and drag him to the shaft by which they came down. They disappear, mounting upward.) (The scene changes as before, only in reverse order. The scene in changing again passes near the smithies. Continuous change of scene upward.) (Wotan and Loge, bringing with them Alberich bound, come up out of the chasm.)Scene Four An open space on a mountain height (The prospect is shrouded in pale mist, as at the end of the second scene.) Loge There, kinsman, take now thy seat! Look around thee, there lies the world, that so fain thou wouldst win for thine own: what corner, say, wilt give to me for a stall? (He snaps his fingers, dancing around Alberich.) Alberich Infamous robber! Thou rogue! Thou knave! Loosen the rope, let me go free; or dearly shalt pay for thy trespass! Wotan A captive art thou, fast in my fetters; as thou didst ween the living world now lay at thy will before thee, thou liest bound at my feet. Deny it, trembler, thou canst not! To make thyself free, now pay me the ransom. Alberich O, thou dolt, thou dreaming fool, to trust blindly the treacherous thief! fearful revenge shall follow the crime! Loge Art thirsting for vengeance? must first, then, win thyself free: to a man in bonds the free pay nought for a trespass. Then dream\\'st thou of vengeance, quickly bestir thee, think of thy ransom betimes! (He shows him by snapping his fingers the kind of ransom.)Alberich Then say what ye demand! Wotan The hoard and thy gleaming gold. Alberich Thievish and ravenous gang! (aside) But if only I keep the ring, the hoard I may lightly let go; for anew were it won, and right merrily fed were it soon by the spell of the ring; and a warning it were to render me wise; not dearly the lesson were paid, though for its gain I lose the gold. Wotan Dost yield up the hoard? Alberich Loosen my hand to summon it here. (Loge unties the rope from his right hand. Alberich touches the ring with his lips and secretly murmurs a command.) Behold, the Nibelungs hither are called! By their lord commanded now from the dark to the daylight they bring up the hoard; then loosen these torturing bonds! Wotan Not yet, till all hath been paid. (The Nibelungs ascend from the cleft, laden with the treasures of the hoard. During the following the Nibelungs pile up the hoard.)Alberich O shame and disgrace! that my shrinking bondsmen themselves should see me in bonds! (to the Nibelungs) There let it lie, as I command! In a heap pile up the hoard! Dolts, must I help you? Nay, look not on me! Haste, there! haste! Then hence with you homeward, straight to your work! Off to your smithing! Woe, if idlers ye be! At your heels I follow you hard! (He kisses his ring and stretches it out command- ingly. As if struck with a blow, the Nibelungs rush cowering and terrified toward the cleft, into which they quickly disappear.) There lies ransom; now let me go: and the tarnhelm there, that Loge yet holds; that give me in kindness again! Loge (throwing the tarnhelm on the hoard) The plunder must pay for the pardon.Alberich Accursed thief! But wait a while! He who forged me the one makes me another; still mine is the might that Mime obeys. Sad it seems that crafty foes should capture my cunning defense! Well then! Alberich all has given; now loose, ye tyrants, his bonds! Loge Art thou contented? shall he go free? Wotan A golden ring gleams on thy finger: hear\\'st thou, dwarf? that also belongs to the hoard. Alberich (horrified) The ring? Wotan To win thee free, that too must thou leave us. Alberich (trembling) My life, but not the ring! Wotan (more violently) The ring surrender: with thy life do what thou wilt. Alberich If but my life be left me, the ring too must I deliver; hand and head, eye and ear are not mine more truly than mine is this golden ring!Wotan Thine own thou callest the ring? Ravest thou, impudent Niblung? Truly tell how thou gottest the gold, from which the bright trinket was shaped. Was\\'t thine own, then, which thou, rogue, from the Rhine\\'s deep waters hast reft? To the maidens hie thee, ask thou of them if their gold for thine own they have given, which thou hast robbed for the ring! Alberich Infamous tricksters! Shameful deceit! Thief, dost cast in my teeth the crime, so dearly wished for by thee? How fain wert thou to steal the gold for thyself, were but the craft to forge it as easily gained? How well, thou knave, it works for thy weal, that the Niblung, I, from shameful defeat, and by fury driven, the terrible magic did win whose work laughs cheerly on thee! Shall this hapless and anguish-torn one\\'s curse-laden, fearfullest deed but serve now to win thee this glorious toy? Shall my ban bring a blessing on thee? Heed thyself, o\\'erweening god! If I have sinned, I sinned but against myself: but against all that was, is and shall be sinn\\'st, eternal one, thou if rashly thou seizest my ring!Wotan Yield the ring! No right to that can all thy prating e\\'er win. (He seizes Alberich, and with violence draws the ring from his finger.) Alberich (with a horrible cry) Ha! Defeated! Destroyed! Of wretches the wretchedest slave! Wotan (contemplating the ring) This ring now lifts me on high, the mightiest lord of all might. (He puts on the ring.) Loge (to Wotan) Shall he go free? Wotan Set him free! (Loge sets Alberich entirely free.) Loge (to Alberich) Slip away home! Not a fetter holds thee: free, fare thou now hence!Alberich (raising himself) Am I now free? (enraged laughing) Free in sooth? Thus greets you then this, my freedom\\'s foremost word! As by curse came it to me, accurst be aye this ring! As its gold gave measureless might, let now its magic deal death to its lord! Its wealth shall yield pleasure to none, to gladden none shall its luster laugh! Care shall consume aye him who doth hold it, and envy gnaw him who holdeth it not! All shall lust after its delights, yet nought shall it boot him who wins the prize! To its lord no gain let it bring; yet be murder drawn in its wake! To death devoted, chained be the craven by fear: his whole life long daily wasting away, the treasure\\'s lord as the treasure\\'s slave! Till again once more in my hand regained I shall hold it! So blesses, in sorest need, the Nibelung now his ring: then hold it fast, (laughing) ward it with heed! (angrily) But my curse canst thou not flee. (He vanishes quickly in the cleft.) (The thick mist in the foreground gradually clears away.) Loge Didst thou listen to love\\'s farewell?Wotan (sunk in contemplation of the ring on his hand) Let him give way to his wrath! (It becomes continually lighter.) Loge (looking to the right) Fasolt and Fafner hitherward fare: Freia bring they to us. (Through the dispersing mist Donner, Froh and Fricka appear and hasten toward the foreground.) Froh See, they have returned! Donner Now welcome, brother! Fricka (anxiously to Wotan) Bring\\'st thou joyful tidings? Loge (pointing to the hoard) By cunning and force the task is done: there Freia\\'s ransom lies. Donner From the giant\\'s hold neareth the fair one. Froh What balmiest air wafteth to us, blissful enchantment fills every sense! Sad, in sooth, were our fortune, forever sundered from her, who painless, ne\\'er-ending youth and rapturous joy doth bestow. (The foreground has become bright again, and the aspect of the gods regains in the light its former freshness. The misty veil, however, still covers the background so that the distant castle remains invisible.) (Fasolt and Fafner enter, leading Freia between them. Fricka hastens joyfully toward her sister.)Fricka Loveliest sister, sweetest delight! art thou to us once more given? Fasolt (restraining her) Hold! Touch her not yet! Still we claim her ours. On Riesenheim\\'s fastness of rock took we our rest; in truth and honor the treaty\\'s pledge tended we. Though sorely loth, to you I bring her; now pay us brothers the ransom here. Wotan At hand lies the ransom: in goodly measure the gold shall be meted. Fasolt To lose the woman, know ye, my spirit is sore: if from my heart I must tear her, the treasure hoard heap ye then so, that from my sight the blossoming maid it may hide!Wotan By Freia\\'s form, then, measure the gold! (The two giants place Freia in the middle. They then stick their staves into the ground in front of Freia, so that they give the measure of her height and breadth.) Fafner Fast fixed are our poles there to frame her form; now heap the hoard to their height! Wotan Haste with the work: sorely it irks me! Loge Help me, Froh! Froh Freia\\'s shame straight must be ended. (Loge and Froh hastily heap up the treasure between the poles.) Fafner Not so loosely piled be the gold. (He roughly presses the treasure together.) Firm and close fill up the gauge! (He stoops down to look for crevices.) Here still I see through: come, stop me these crannies! Loge Away, thou rude one! Fafner Look here! Loge Touch thou not aught! Fafner Look here! this cleft must be closed!Wotan (turning away moodily) Deep in my breast burns this disgrace! Fricka See how in shame standeth the glorious maid: for release beseeches her suffering look. Heartless man! our loveliest bears this through thee! Fafner Still more! Pile on still more! Donner I bear no more; foaming rage wakens the rogue in my breast! Come hither, hound! wouldst thou measure, then take thy measure with me! Fafner Patience, Donner! roar where it serves: thy thunder helps thee not here. Donner (aiming a blow) It will serve, scounderel, to crush thee. Wotan Peace, my friend! Methinks now Freia is hid. (Fafner measures the hoard closely with his eye, and looks for crevices.)Loge The hoard is spent. Fafner Yet shines to me Holda\\'s hair: there, yonder toy throw on the hoard! Loge What? e\\'en the helm? Fafner Quickly, here with it! Wotan Let it go also. (Loge throws the Tarnhelm on the pile.) Loge Then all is now finished! Are ye contented? Fasolt Freia, the fair one, see I no more: then, is she released? must I now lose her? (He goes close up and peers through the hoard.) Ah! yet gleams her glance on me here; her eyes like stars send me their beams; still through a cleft I look on their light. (beside himself) While her sweet eyes shine upon me, from the woman will I not turn! Fafner Hey! I charge you, come stop me this crevice! Loge Ne\\'er contented! see ye then not, all spent is the hoard? Fafner Nay, not so, friend! on Wotan\\'s finger gleams the gold of a ring: give that to fill up the crevice! Wotan What? this my ring?Loge Hear ye counsel! the Rhine daughters should own the gold; and to them Wotan will give it. Wotan What pratest thou there? The prize that I have won me, without fear I hold for myself! Loge Evil chance befalls the promise I gave the sorrowing maids! Wotan But thy promise bindeth me not: as booty mine is the ring. Fafner But here for ransom must it be rendered. Wotan Boldly ask what ye will, all I will grant you; for all the world yet I will not yield up the ring! Fasolt (angrily pulls Freia from behind the hoard) All\\'s at end! as erst it stands; now ours is Freia forever! Freia Help me! Help me! Fricka Cruel god! give them their way! Froh Hold not the gold back!Donner Grant them the ring then! (Fafner holds back Fasolt who is pressing to go. All stand confounded.) Wotan Leave me in peace: the ring will I hold! (Wotan turns angrily away from them.) (The stage has again become dark.) (From a rocky cleft on one side breaks forth a bluish light in which Erda becomes suddenly visible, rising from below to half her height.) Erda (stretching her hand warningly toward Wotan) Yield it, Wotan! Yield it! Flee the ring\\'s dread curse! Hopeless and darksome disaster lies hid in its might. Wotan What woman warneth me thus? Erda All that e\\'er was know I; how all things are, how all things will be see I too: the endless world\\'s all-wise one, Erda, warneth thee now. Ere the world was, daughters three of my womb were born; what mine eyes see, nightly the Norns ever tell thee. But danger most dire calleth me hither today. Hear me! Hear me! Hear me! All that e\\'er was endeth! A darksome day dawns for your godhood: be counseled, give up the ring! (Erda sinks slowly as far as the breast. The bluish light begins to fade.)Wotan With mystic awe fills me thy word: go not till more thou tellest! Erda (disappearing) I warned thee; thou know\\'st enough; brood in care and fear! (She completely disappears.) Wotan If then care shall torment me, thee must I capture, all must thou tell me! (Wotan tries to go into the chasm to stay Erda. Froh and Fricka throw themselves in his way and hold him back.) Fricka What wouldst thou, raging one? Froh Go not, Wotan! Touch not the Wala, heed well her words! (Wotan gazes thoughtfully before him.)Donner (turning to the giants with resolution) Hear, ye giants! come back and wait ye! the gold shall be your guerdon. Freia Dare I then hope it? Deem ye Holda truly such ransom worth? (All look attentively at Wotan; he, rousing himself from deep thought, grasps his spear and brandishes it in token of a bold decision.) Wotan To me, Freia! Thou shalt be freed. Bought with the gold, bring us our youth once again! Ye giants, take now your ring! (He throws the ring on the hoard. The giants let Freia go: she hastens joyfully to the gods, who for some time caress her in turn, with the greatest delight.) (Fafner meanwhile spreads out a huge sack and goes to the hoard, preparing to pack it all up.) Fasolt (to Fafner) Stay, thou greedy one! Something give me too! Justice in sharing fits us brothers. Fafner More for the maid than the gold hungered thy lovesick look; I scarce could bring thee, fool, to the bargain; as without sharing Freia thou wouldst have wooed, if now I share, trust me to seize on the greater half for myself.Fasolt Shame on thee, thief! Tauntest thou me? (to the gods) You call I as judges: say how the hoard shall justly be halved! (Wotan turns contemptuously away.) Loge The hoard let him ravish; hold but thou fast to the ring! (Fasolt throws himself on Fafner, who has mean- while been busily packing up.) Fasolt Away! Thou rascal! mine is the ring; mine was it for Freia\\'s glance! (He snatches hastily at the ring. They struggle together.) Fafner Touch thou it not! the ring is mine! (Fasolt wrests the ring from Fafner.) Fasolt I have it, fast I hold it! Fafner (striking out with his staff) Hold it fast lest it should fall!(With one blow he stretches Fasolt on the ground: from the dying man he then hastily wrests the ring.) Now gloat thou on Freia\\'s glance! For the ring seest thou no more! (He puts the ring into the sack and quietly goes on packing the hoard. All the gods stand horrified. A long solemn silence.) Wotan (deeply stirred) Fearful now, appeareth the curse\\'s power! Loge Thy luck, Wotan, where were its equal? Much was gained when the ring thou didst win; but that now thou hast lost it boots thee yet more: for thy foe-men—see!—murder their friends for the gold thou hast let go. Wotan What dark boding doth bind me? Care and fear fetter my soul: how I may end them, teach me, then, Erda: to her must I descend! Fricka (caressing him cajolingly) Where stay\\'st thou, Wotan? Lures thee not friendly the fortress proud? Now it awaits with kindly shelter its lord. Wotan (gloomily) With evil wage paid was the work!Donner (pointing to the background which is still wrapped in a veil of mist) Sultrily mists float in the air; heavy hangeth the glomy weight! Ye hovering clouds, come now with lightning and thunder and sweep the heavens clear! (Donner has mounted on a high rock by the precipice and now swings his hammer: during the following the mists collect around him.) Heda! Heda! Hedo! To me, all ye mists! Ye vapors, to me! Donner, your lord, calleth his hosts! (He swings his hammer.) At his hammer\\'s swing hitherward sweep! Vapors and fogs! Wandering mists! Donner, your lord, calleth his hosts! Heda! Heda! Hedo! (Donner disappears entirely in an ever-darkening and thickening thundercloud.) (The stroke of his hammer is heard to fall heavily on the rock. A vivid flash of lightning comes from the cloud; a violent clap of thunder follows.) (Froh has also disappeared into the clouds.)(unseen) Brother, to me! Shew them the way o\\'er the bridge! (Suddenly the clouds disperse; Donner and Froh become visible: from their feet a rainbow bridge stretches with blinding radiance across the valley to the castle which now glows in the light of the setting sun.) (Fafner, who beside his brother\\'s body has collected the entire hoard, puts the enormous sack on his back and during Donner\\'s magic thunder- storm leaves the stage.) (Froh points with outstretched hand to the bridge as the way across the valley.) Froh (to the gods) The bridge leads you homeward, light yet firm to your feet: now tread undaunted its terrorless path! (Wotan and the other gods contemplate the glorious sight, speechless.) Wotan Golden at eve the sunlight gleameth; in glorious light glow fastness and fell. In the morning\\'s radiance, bravely it glistened, lying lordless there, proudly luring my feet. From morning till evening, in care and fear, unblest, I worked for its winning! The night is nigh: from all its ills shelter it offers now. (as though seized by a great thought, very firmly) So greet I the home, safe from dismay and dread! (He turns solemnly to Fricka.) Follow me, wife! In Walhall dwell now with me.Fricka What meaneth the name, then? Strange \\'tis, methinks, to my hearing. Wotan What my spirit has found to master my dread, when triumph is won, maketh the meaning clear. (He takes Fricka by the hand and walks slowly with her toward the bridge: Froh, Freia and Donner follow.) Loge (remaining in the foreground and looking after the gods) They are hasting on to their end, who now deem themselves strong in their greatness. Ashamed am I to share in their dealings; to flickering fire again to transform me, fancy lureth my will: to burn and waste them who bound me erewhile, rather than blindly sink with the blind e\\'en were they of gods the most godlike not ill were it, meseems! I must bethink me: who knows what may hap? (He goes, assuming a careless manner, to join the gods.)Rhine Daughters (in the valley, unseen) Rhine-gold! Rhine-gold! guileless gold! how brightly and clear shimmered thy beams on us! (Wotan, preparing to set his foot on the bridge, stops and turns around.) Wotan What plaints come hither to me? Rhine Daughters For thy pure luster now lament we: Loge (looks down into the valley) The river children bewailing the stolen gold. Rhine Daughters Give us the gold, give us the gold! Wotan Accursed nixies! Rhine Daughters O give us its glory again.Wotan Cease their clamorous taunts. Loge (calling down toward the valley) Ye in the water! why wail ye to us? Hear what Wotan doth grant! Gleams no more on you maidens the gold, in the newborn godly splendor bask ye henceforth in bliss! (The gods laugh and cross the bridge during the following.) Rhine Daughters Rhine-gold! Rhine-gold! guileless gold! O would that thy treasure were glittering yet in the deep! Tender and true \\'tis but in the waters: false and base are all who revel above!

(The inside of a dwelling place; an apartment built of wood surrounds the stem of a great ash tree standing in the center. On the right, in the fore- ground, is the hearth, behind it the storeroom; at back, the great entrance door; on the left, at back, steps lead up to an inner room; lower down, on the same side, a table with a broad bench behind it, fixed to the wall; some wooden stools in front of it.) (The stage remains a while empty; storm without, just subsiding.) (Siegmund opens the entrance door from without and enters. He holds the latch in his hand and looks round the room: he appears exhausted with over- exertion: his dress and appearance show that he is in flight. Seeing no one, he closes the door behind him, walks, as with the last efforts of an exhausted man, to the hearth, and there throws himself down on a rug of bearskin.)Siegmund Whoe\\'er own this hearth, here must I rest me. (He sinks back and remains stretched out motionless.) (Sieglinde enters from the inner chamber, thinking that her husband has returned. Her grave look shows surprise when she finds a stranger stretched on the hearth.) Sieglinde (still at the back) A stranger here? why came he hither? (She comes nearer.) What man is this who lies on the hearth? (As Siegmund does not move, she comes still nearer and looks at him.) Worn and way-weary lies he there. Is it but weariness? or is he sick? (She bends over him and listens.) I hear still his breathing, \\'tis sleep that hath seized him. Valiant is he, meseems, though so worn he lies. Siegmund (suddenly raising his head) A draught! a draught! Sieglinde I bring thee water. (She quickly takes a drinking horn and goes out. She returns with it filled and offers it to Siegmund.) Drink to moisten thy lips I have brought thee: Water, as thou didst wish! (Siegmund drinks and gives the horn back. As he signs his thanks with his head, his eyes fix themselves on her with growing interest.)Siegmund Cooling relief the water has wrought, my weary load now is made light: refreshed is my heart, mine eyes are gladdened by blissful raptures of sight. Who is\\'t that gladdens them so? Sieglinde This house and this wife call Hunding owner; stranger, take here thy rest: tarry till he return! Siegmund Weaponless am I: a wounded guest will thy husband make welcome. Sieglinde (with anxious haste) Thy wounds now shew to me straight! (Siegmund shakes himself and springs up quickly to a sitting position.) Siegmund But slight are they, unworthy a word; still whole are my limbs and trustily knit. If but half so well as my arm shield and spear had availed me, ne\\'er from foe had I fled; but in splinters were spear and shield. The horde of foe-men harried me sore, by storm and stress spent was my force; but quicker than I from foe-men fled my faintness from me: darkness had sunk on my lids; now laughs the sunlight anew. (Sieglinde goes to the storeroom, fills a horn with mead, and offers it to Siegmund with friendly eagerness.)Sieglinde A quickening draught of honeyed mead may\\'st thou not scorn from me. Siegmund Let it first touch thy lips? (Sieglinde sips from the horn and gives it back. Siegmund takes a long draught, while his gaze rests on her with growing warmth. Still gazing, he removes the horn from his lips and lets it sink slowly while the expression of his features expresses strong emotion. He sighs deeply and gloomily lets his eyes sink to the ground.) (with trembling voice) Thou hast tended an ill-fated one: (quickly) ill-fate would I might turn from thee! (He starts up.) Good rest I found here and sweet repose: onward wend I my way. (He goes toward the back.) Sieglinde (turning quickly around) Who pursues thee, that thou must fly? Siegmund (has stopped) Ill-fate pursues me where\\'er I wander; Ill-fate o\\'ertakes me where\\'er I linger: to thee, wife, ne\\'er may it come! forth from thy house I fly. (He goes hastily to the door and lifts the latch.)Sieglinde (in impetuous self-forgetfulness, calling to him) Then bide thou here! Ill-fate thou canst not bring there, where ill-fate has made its home! (Siegmund, deeply moved, remains standing, he looks searchingly at Sieglinde, who casts down her eyes in shame and sadness. Siegmund returns.) Siegmund Wehwalt called I myself: Hunding here then shall find me. (He leans against the hearth: his eyes fix them- selves with calm and steady sympathy on Sieglinde: she slowly raises her eyes again to his; they regard each other, during a long silence, with an expression of the deepest emotion.)Scene Two (Sieglinde starts, listens, and hears Hunding, who is leading his horse to the stable outside. She goes quickly to the door and opens it. Hunding, armed with shield and spear, enters and pauses at the threshold on perceiving Siegmund. Hunding turns to Sieglinde with a look of stern enquiry.) Sieglinde (answering Hunding\\'s look) Faint, this man lay on our hearth: need drove him to us. Hunding Hast tended him? Sieglinde A draught I gave to him, welcomed him as guest! Siegmund (firmly and quietly watching Hunding) Rest and drink offered she: wouldst therefore chide the woman? Hunding Sacred is my hearth: sacred hold thou my house. (He takes off his armor, and gives it to Sieglinde.) (to Sieglinde) Set the meal now for us! (Sieglinde hangs the arms on the branches of the ash tree, fetches food and drink from the storeroom, and prepares supper.) (Involuntarily she again turns her gaze on Siegmund.) (Hunding looks keenly and with surprise at Siegmund\\'s features, which he compares with Sieglinde\\'s.) (aside) How like to the woman! The serpent\\'s deceit glistens, too, in his glances. (He hides his surprise and turns unconcernedly to Siegmund.) Far, I trow, led thee thy way; no horse rode he who here found rest: what rugged paths have wearied thy feet?Siegmund Through brake and forest, meadow and moor, storm has pursued and sorest need: I know not the way I have come. Whither it led me, also I know not: fain would I learn it from thee. Hunding (at the table, offering Siegmund a seat) The roof and room that shelter thee, Hunding calls his own; wendest thou hence to the west thy way, in homesteads rich findest thou kinsmen who guard the honor of Hunding: guest, now grant me a grace, and thy name make known in return. (Siegmund, who has taken his place at the table, gazes thoughtfully before him. Sieglinde has placed herself next to Hunding, opposite to Siegmund, on whom she fastens her eyes with visible sympathy and intentness.) (watches them both) Fearest thou to give me thy trust, to the wife here tell thy secret: see her longing in her looks! Sieglinde (unembarrassed and interested) Guest, who thou art I would know. (Siegmund looks up, gazes into her eyes and begins gravely.) Siegmund Friedmund may I not call me; Frohwalt, would that I were: but Wehwalt so must I name me. Wolfe, I called my father: alone was I not born; for a sister twinned with me. Soon lost were both mother and maid; her who me bore, her who with me was born, scarce have I ever beheld. Warlike and strong was Wolfe, and foes full many he found. A-hunting oft went the son with the father; once, worn from the chase, we came to our home, there lay the wolf\\'s nest waste. To ashes burnt the goodly abode,to dust the oak tree\\'s branching stem; struck dead was the mother\\'s valorous form, and lost in the ruins the sister\\'s trace: the Neidings\\' cruel host had dealt us this deadly blow. Unfriended fled my father with me; many years the stripling lived on with Wolfe in woodlands wild: oft beset were we by our foes; but bravely battled the Wolf-pair still. (turning to Hunding) A Wolfing tells thee the tale whom as \"Wolfing\" many well know. Hunding Marvels and monstrous stories tellest thou, daring guest, Wehwalt the Wolfing!Methinks, of the warrior pair I heard dark rumors spoken, though I nor Wolfe nor Wölfing knew. Sieglinde Yet further tell us, stranger: where roams thy father now? Siegmund A fiery onset on us then did the Neidings begin: but slain by the wolves fell many a hunter, in flight through the woods, chased by their game, like chaff were scattered the foes. But torn from my father was I; his trace I saw not though long was my seeking: in the woods a wolfskin found I alone; there, empty it lay; my father found I not. From the woods driven afar; my heart longed for men and for women. Amongst all folk, where\\'er I fared, if friend or wife I sought to win, still was I ever mistrusted: ill-fate lay on me. Whate\\'er right thing I wrought, others counted it ill; what seemed evil to me, others greeted as good. In feuds I fell wherever I dwelt, wrath met me wherever I fared; striving for gladness, woe was my lot: my name then be Wehwalt ever; for woe still waits on my steps. (He turns his eyes to Sieglinde and notes her sympathetic look.)Hunding She who cast thee fate so forlorn, the Norn then loved thee not: gladly greets thee no man to whom as guest thou com\\'st. Sieglinde Craven hearts only fear a weaponless, lonely man! Tell us yet, guest, how in the fight at last thy weapon was lost? Siegmund A sorrowful child cried for my help: her kinsmen sought to bind in wedlock unloved, a man with the maid. Help against wrong gladly I gave, her ruthless clan met me in fight: before me foe-men fell. Struck down and dead lay her brothers: her arms round their bodies she clasped, her grief had banished her wrath. From wildly streaming eyes she bathed the dead with her tears; for her brothers in battle slain lamented the ill -fated bride. Then the host of kinsmen surged like a storm; full of fury, vengeance they vowed on me: ever new foe-men rose to assail me.But from the place ne\\'er moved the maid; my shield and spear sheltered her long, till spear and shield were hewn from my hand. Wounded, weaponless stood I; death I saw take the maid: I fled from the furious host; lifeless lay she on the dead. (to Sieglinde with a look of sorrowful fervor) Now know\\' st thou, questioning wife, why \\'tis not Friedmund who greets thee! (He stands up and walks to the hearth. Sieglinde looks on the ground pale and deeply moved.) Hunding (rises) I know a riotous race; not holy it holds what men revere: \\'tis hated by all and by me. For vengeance forth was I summoned, payment to win me for kinsmen\\'s blood: too late came I, and now return home, the flying outcast\\'s trace to find again in my house. (He comes down.) My house holds thee, Wolfing, today; for the night, safe be thy rest: with trusty weapon defend thee tomorrow; I choose the day for the fight: as death-debt pa/ st thou thy life. (With anxious gestures Sieglinde steps between the two men.) (harshly) Hence from the hall! linger not here! My night-draught set me within, and wait thou there for me. (Sieglinde stands a while undecided and thought- ful. She turns slowly and with hesitation steps toward the storeroom. There she again pauses and remains standing, lost in thought, with half-averted face. With quiet resolution she opens the cupboard, fills a drinking horn, and shakes some spices into it from a box. She then turns her eyes on Siegmund so as to meet his gaze which he keeps unceasingly fixed on her.) (She perceives Hunding watching them and turns immediately to the bedchamber. On the steps she turns once more, looks yearningly at Siegmund andindicates with her eyes, persistently and with eloquest earnestness, a particular spot in the ash tree\\'s stem.) (Hunding starts and drives her with a violent gesture from the room.) (With a last look at Siegmund, she goes into the bed chamb er and closes the door after her.)(taking his weapons from the tree stem) With weapons man should be armed. (Going, he turns to Siegmund.) Thou, Wölfing, meet me tomorrow: my word hearest thou, ward thyself well! (He goes into the chamber; the closing of the bolt is heard from within.)Scene Three (Siegmund alone. It has become quite dark. The hall is only lighted by a dull fire on the hearth.) (Siegmund sinks on a bench by the fire and broods silently for some time in great agitation.) Siegmund A sword, my father foretold me, should serve me in sorest need. Swordless I come to my foe-man\\'s house; as a hostage here helpless I lie: a wife saw I, wondrous and fair, and blissful tremors seized my heart. The woman who holds me chained, who with sweet enchantment wounds, in thrall is held by the man who mocks his weaponless foe. Wälse! Wälse! Where is thy sword? The trusty sword, that in fight shall serve me, when from my bosom outbreaks the fury my heart now bears? (The fire falls together. From the flame which springs up a bright light strikes on the spot in the ash stem indicated by Sieglinde\\'s look, on which a sword hilt is now clearly seen.)What gleameth there from out the gloom? What a beam breaks from the ash tree\\'s stem! The sightless eye beholdeth a flash: gay as laughter its light! How the glorious gleam doth pierce my heart! Is it the glance of the woman so fair that there clinging behind her she left as from the hall she passed? (The fire now gradually sinks.) Darkening shadow covered mine eyes, but her glance\\'s beam fell on me then: bringing me warmth and day. Blessing came with the sun\\'s bright rays; the gladdening splendor encircled my head, till behind mountains it sank. (Another faint gleam from the fire.) Once more, ere day went hence, fell a gleam on me here; e\\'en the ancient ash tree\\'s stem shone forth with a golden glow: now pales the splendor, the light dies out; darkening shadow gathers around me: deep in my breast alone yet glimmers a dim, dying glow. (The fire is quite extinguished: complete darkness.) (The door at the side opens softly. Sieglinde, in a white garment, comes out and advances lightly but quickly toward the hearth.) Sieglinde Sleep\\'st thou, guest? Siegmund (in joyful surprise) Who whispers there?Sieglinde (with furtive haste) It is I: list to my words! In deepest sleep lies Hunding; o\\'ercome by a slumberous draught: now, in the night, save thy life! Siegmund (interrupting her passionately) Thy coming is life! Sieglinde A weapon let me now shew thee: o might\\'st thou make it thine! The first of heroes then might I call thee: to the strongest alone was it decreed. O heed thou well what I now tell thee! The kinsmen gathered here in the hall, to honor the wedding of Hunding: the woman he chose, by him unwooed, miscreants gave him to wife. Sad I sat the while they were drinking; a stranger entered the hall: an old man clad all in grey low down hung his hat, and one of his eyes was hidden; at the other\\'s flash fear came on all men when their eyes met its threat\\'ning glance: yet on me lingered his look with sweet yearning regret, sorrow and solace in one. On me glancing, he glared on the others, as a sword he swung in his hands;which then he struck in the ash tree stem; to the hilt buried it lies: but one man might win the weapon, he who could draw it forth. Of all the heroes, though bravely they labored, not one the weapon could win; guests came hither and guests departed; the strongest tugged at the steel ... not a whit it stirred in the stem: there cleaves in silence the sword. Then knew I who he was who in sorrow greeted me: I know too who alone shall draw the sword from the stem. O might I today find here the friend; come from afar to the saddest wife: what e\\'er I have suffered in bitterest pain, what e\\'er I have borne in shame and disgrace, sweet were my vengeance, all were atoned for! Regained were then whate\\'er I had lost, and won, too, were then all I have wept for, found the delivering friend, my hero held in my arms! Siegmund (embracing Sieglinde with ardor) Thee, woman most blest, holds now the friend, for weapon and wife decreed! Hot in my breast burns now the oath that weds me ever to thee. Whate\\'er I have sought in thee now I see; in thee all that has failed me is found! Though thou wert shamed and woe was my lot; though I was scorned and dishonored wert thou: joyful revenge now laughs in our gladness! Loud laugh I in fullest delight, holding embraced all thy glory, feeling the beats of thy heart! (The great door springs open.)Sieglinde Ha, who went? who entered here? (The door remains open: outside a glorious spring night; the full moon shines in, throwing its bright light on the pair, so that suddenly they can fully and clearly see each other.) Siegmund (in gentle ecstasy) No one went, but one has come: laughing, the spring enters the hall! (Siegmund draws Sieglinde to him on the couch with tender vehemence, so that she sits beside him. Increas ing brilliance of the moonlight.) Winter storms have waned in the moon of May, with tender radiance sparkles the spring; on balmy breezes, light and lovely, weaving wonders, on he floats; o\\'er wood and meadow wafts his breathing, widely open laughs his eye: in blithesome song of birds resounds his voice, sweetest fragrance breathes he forth: from his ardent blood bloom out all joy-giving blossoms, bud and shoot spring up by his might. With gentle weapons\\' charm he forces the world; winter and storm yield to his strong attack: assailed by his hardy strokes now the doors are shattered that, fast and defiant, once held us parted from him. To clasp his sister hither he flew; \\'twas love that lured the spring: within our bosoms deeply she hid; now gladly she laughs to the light. The bride and sister is freed by the brother; in ruin lies what held them apart; joyfully greet now the loving pair: made one are love and spring!Sieglinde Thou art the spring that I have so longed for in frosty winter\\'s spell. My heart greeted thee with blissfullest dread, as thy look at first on me lightened. Strange has seemed all I e\\'er saw, friendless all that was round me; like far off things and unknown, all that ever came near. When thou camest all was made clear: as my eyes on thee fell, mine wert thou only: all I hid in my heart, all I am; bright as the day dawned on my sight, like echoing tones struck on my ear, as in winter\\'s frosty desert my eyes first beheld the friend. (She hangs in rapture on his neck and gazes closely into his face.) Siegmund (with transport) O sweetest enchantment! woman most blest! Sieglinde (close to his eyes) O let me closer to thee still press me and see more clearly the holy light that forth from eyes and face doth break and so sweetly sways all my sense. Siegmund Beneath spring\\'s moon shinest thou bright; wrapped in glory of waving hair:what has ensnared me now well I know in rapture feasteth my look. Sieglinde (pushes the locks back from his brow and gazes at him with astonishment) How broadly shines thy open brow, the wandering veins in thy temples entwine! I tremble with the rapture of my delight! A marvel wakes my remembrance: my eyes beheld thee of old whom first I saw today! Siegmund A love-dream wakes in me the thought: in fiery longing cam\\'st thou to me! Sieglinde The stream has shewn me my pictured face, and now again I behold it: as from the water it rose, show\\'st thou my image anew! Siegmund Thou art the image I held in my heart. Sieglinde (quickly turning her eyes away from him) O hush! again the voice is sounding: I\\xa0heard it, methinks, once as a child— but no! of late I have heard it, (excitedly) yes, when the echo\\'s sound gave back my voice in the woods. Siegmund O loveliest song that sounds as I listen! Sieglinde (again gazing into his eyes) Thine eyes\\' bright glow erewhile on me shone: the stranger so glanced, greeting the wife, as he soothed with his look her grief. By his glance then knew him his child; almost by his name did I call him! (pausing) Wehwalt art thou in truth?Siegmund Ne\\'er call me so, since thou art mine: now won is the highest rapture! Sieglinde And Friedmund may\\'st thou gladly not name thee? Siegmund Call me, thyself, as thou wouldst I were called: my name I take but from thee! Sieglinde Yet calledst thou Wolfe thy father? Siegmund Wolf was he to fearful foxes! But he whose eye proudly did glisten, as, fairest one, glistens thine own, of old, Wälse was named. Sieglinde (beside herself) Was Wälse thy father, and art thou a Wälsung? Struck was for thee the sword in the stem, so let me now name thee as I have loved thee:Siegmund, so name I thee! Siegmund (springs up) Siegmund call me for Siegmund am I! Be witness this sword I hold now undaunted! Wälse foretold me in sorest need this should I find: I grasp it now! Holiest love\\'s most highest need, love-longing\\'s piercing passionate need, burning bright in my breast, drives to deeds and death: Nothung! Nothung! so name I thee, sword. Nothung! Nothung! conquering steel! Shew now thy biting, severing blade! come forth from thy scabbard to me! (With a powerful effort Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree, and shows it to the astonished and enraptured Sieglinde.) Siegmund, the Wälsung, seest thou here! As bride-gift he brings thee this sword; so wins for him the woman most blest; from foe-man\\'s house thus bears her away. Far from here follow me now, forth to the laughing house of spring: there guards thee Nothung the sword, when Siegmund lies captive to love! (He has embraced her in order to draw her away with him.) Sieglinde (in highest excitement tears herself away and stands before him.) Art thou Siegmund, standing before me? Sieglinde am I, who for thee longed: thine own twin sister thou winnest at once with the sword! (She throws herself on his breast.) Siegmund Bride and sister be to thy brother: then flourish the Wälsungs for aye! (He draws her to him with passionate fervor. The curtain falls rapidly.)Act Two Prelude and Scene One (The curtain rises.) (A wild rocky place. In the background a gorge slopes from below to a high ridge of rocks, from which the ground again sinks to the front.)Wotan (fully armed, carrying his spear, before him Brünnhilde, as a Valkyrie, likewise fully armed) Now bridle thy horse, warrior maid; soon will blaze furious strife. Brünnhilde, haste to the fray to shield the Wälsung in fight! There let Hunding go where he belongs; in Walhall want I him not. Then, ready and fleet, ride to the field. Brünnhilde (springs shouting from rock to rock up the height on the right) Hojotoho! hojotoho! heiaha! heiaha! hojotoho! hojotoho! heiaha! heiaha! hojotoho! hojotoho! hojotoho! hojotoho! heiaha ha! hojoho! (On a high peak she stops, looks into the gorge at the back, and calls to Wotan.) Take warning, Father, look to thyself; storm and strife must thou withstand. Fricka comes to thee here, drawn hither in her car by her rams. Hei! how she swings the golden scourge! The wretched beasts are groaning with fear; wheels furiously rattle; fierce she fares to the fray. In strife like this I take no delight, sweet though to me are the fights of men; then take now thy stand for the storm: I leave thee with mirth to thy fate. Hojotoho! hojotoho! heiaha! heiaha! hojotoho! hojotoho! heiaha! heiaha! hojotoho! hojotoho! hojotoho! hojotoho! heiaha ha! (Brünnhilde disappears behind the mountain height at the side.) (Fricka, in a car drawn by two rams, comes up from the ravine to the top of the pass, where she stops suddenly and alights. She strides impetuously toward Wotan in the foreground.)Wotan (seeing Fricka approaching him; aside) The wonted storm, the wonted strife! But firm here must I hold me! Fricka (as she approaches, moderates her pace and places herself with dignity before Wotan) Where in mountain wilds thou hid\\'st, to shun the eyes of thy wife, lonely here seek I thee out, that help to me thou may\\'st promise. Wotan What troubles Fricka freely be told. Fricka I have heard Hunding\\'s cry, for vengeance called he on me, and wedlock\\'s guardian gave ear to him: I made oath to punish the deed of this infamous pair who rashly wrought him a wrong. Wotan What so evil wrought the pair whom spring united in love? \\'Twas love\\'s enchantment enraptured them; I rule not where love doth reign. Fricka Thou feign\\'st to be foolish and deaf, as though thou knew\\'st not, in sooth, that now for wedlock\\'s holy oath, profaned so rudely, I call thee! Wotan Unholy hold I the oath that binds unloving hearts; from me, prithee, do not demand that by force I hold what withstands thy power: for where bold spirits are moving, I stir them ever to strife.Fricka Deemest thou praiseworthy wedlock\\'s breach, then prate thou yet farther and call it holy that shame now blossom forth from bond of a twin-born pair!I shudder at heart, my reason doth faint, brother embraced as bride his own sister! When was it e\\'er known that brother and sister were lovers? Wotan Known \\'tis now to thee! Then learn thou so what unhelped may happen, though never before it befell. That love has enslaved them, clearly thou seest; then words of wisdom now hear: that sweetest bliss for thy blessing reward thee, with loving laughter bless thou Siegmund\\'s and Sieglinde\\'s bond. Fricka (breaking out in deep indignation) Is all, then, at end with the glory of godhood since thou begatt\\'st the riotous Wälsungs? I now speak it; pierced is thy thought? Nought worth is to thee the race of eternals! Away thou castest what once thou didst honor; thou breakest the bonds thou thyself hast ordained, loosest laughing all heaven\\'s hold that in wanton freedom may flourish this insolent twin-born pair, of thy falseness the unholy fruit.O why wail I o\\'er wedlock and vows which thyself thou first hast profaned. The truest wife thou still hast betrayed; never a deep and never a height but there turned thirsting ever thy looks, as thy changeful humor allured thee, and stung my heart with thy scorn. Saddened in spirit, must I behold thee fare to the fight with the graceless maidens, whom lawless love hath given to thee: for thy wife still fearedst thou so, that the Valkyries\\' band and Brünnhild\\' herself, thine own wish\\'s bride, to the goddess as handmaids thou gav\\'st. But now, when unwonted names have ensnared thee, as \"Wälse\" wolfish in woods thou hast wandered; now that to deepest disgrace thou hast fallen, to foster mortals begot of thy falseness: shamed by whelps of a wolf thou fling\\'st at thy feet, too, thy wife! Then finish thy work! Fill now the cup! The betrayed one trample beneath thee! Wotan (quietly) Nought learnedst thou when I would teach thee what never canst thou discern, till day has dawned on the deed. Wonted things only canst thou conceive, but what ne\\'er yet befell, thereon broodeth my thought. This thing hear thou! Needed is one who, free from help of the godhead, fights free from the godhead\\'s control. So alone were he meet for the deed which, tho\\' the need of our godhood, to achieve is denied to a god. Fricka With darksome meanings wouldst thou mislead me: was aught of worth to heroes e\\'er granted which to their gods themselves was denied, by whose grace alone they may work?Wotan Their own spirit\\'s freedom count\\'st thou for nought? Fricka Who breathed their souls into men? Who lightened their purblind eyes? Behind thy shield bold is their mien, spurred on by thee they strive to arise: thou stirr\\'st them alone whom to me, thy wife, thou dost laud. With new deceit wilt thou now delude me? by new devices wouldst thou escape me? but not this Wälsung from me shalt thou win; in him find I but thee, for through thee dares he alone. Wotan In sorest sorrow (with emotion) he wrought for himself: my shield sheltered him not. Fricka Today, then, shield him not! Take back the sword that thou hast bestowed. Wotan The sword? Fricka Aye, the sword, the magical, glittering sword, that thou, god, didst give thy son! Wotan (violently) Siegmund has won it himself (with tremulous voice) in his need. (From here Wotan\\'s whole demeanor expresses ever-increasing uneasiness and gloom.)Fricka (continuing vehemently) Thou brought\\'st him the need, and the conquering sword. Wouldst thou deceive me who day and night in thy footsteps have fared? For him struckest thou the sword in the stem, thou didst promise him the sacred blade; wilt thou deny, then, that thy craft alone had lured him where it lay hid? (Wotan makes a wrathful gesture.) (more and more confident, as she sees the impression she has made on Wotan) The gods do not battle with bondsmen, the free but punish transgressors. Tho\\' against thy might war have I waged: yet Siegmund shall fall as my slave. (Wotan makes another vehement gesture, then appears overcome by the feeling of his powerlessness.) He who as bondsman bendeth before thee, shall he outbrave thy eternal bride? Shall in my shame the basest one scorn me? to the forward a spur, a scoff to the free! That can my husband not wish me, not so shall a goddess be shamed. Wotan (gloomy) What demand\\'st thou? Fricka Shield not the Wälsung!Wotan (with muffled voice) His way let him go. Fricka But thou shelter him not, when to arms the avenger calls! Wotan I shelter him not. Fricka (more animatedly) Seek not to trick me, look in my eyes: the Valkyrie turn, too, from him! Wotan The Valkyrie free shall choose. Fricka Not so; for alone thy command she obeys: give order that Siegmund fall. Wotan (breaking out, after a violent inner struggle) I cannot o\\'erthrow him, he found my sword. Fricka Destroy then its magic, be shattered the steel! Shieldless let him be found! (Brünnhilde\\'s call is heard from the heights.) Brünnhilde Heiaha! heiaha! Hojotoho! Fricka There comes now thy valiant maid: shouting hither she fares.Brünnhilde Heiaha! heiaha! Heiohotojo hotojoha! Wotan I called her for Siegmund to horse! (Brünnhilde appears with her horse on the rocky path to the right. On seeing Fricka she breaks off suddenly and, during the following, she slowly and silently leads her horse down the mountain path and hides it in a cave.) Fricka Thy eternal consort\\'s holiest honor her shield shall guard today! Derided by men, deprived of our might, surely we gods were o\\'erthrown, were today my right, resplendent and pure, not avenged by thy valorous maid. The Wälsung falls for my honor: Doth Wotan now pledge me his oath? Wotan (throwing himself onto a rocky seat in deep dejection) Take the oath! (Fricka strides toward the back: there she meets Brünnhilde and pauses a moment before her.) Fricka Warfather waits for thee: let him now tell thee how the lot is decreed. (She drives quickly away.) (Brünnhilde comes forward with wondering and anxious mien to Wotan, who, leaning back on the rocky seat, is sunk in gloomy brooding.)Scene Two Brünnhilde Ill surely closed the strife; Fricka laughs at its ending. Father, what woe hast thou to tell me? Gloomy seem\\'st thou and cheerless! Wotan (drops his arm helplessly and lets his head sink on his breast) I lie in fetters forged by me, I, least free of all living! Brünnhilde Ne\\'er saw I thee so: what gnaws at thy heart? (From this point Wotan\\'s expression and gestures grow in intensity, culminating in a fearful outburst.) O infinite shame! O shameful distress! Gods\\' despair! Gods\\' despair! Unbounded rage! Unending grief! Most joyless am I of all living! (Terrified, Brünnhilde throws shield, spear and helmet from her and sinks at Wotan\\'s feet in anxious solicitude.) Father! Father! Tell me what ails thee? Why so fill\\'st thou thy child with dismay? Have trust in me, to thee aye true! See, Brünnhild\\' entreateth. (She lays her head and hands with loving concern on his knees and breast. Wotan looks long in her eyes; then he strokes her hair with unconscious tenderness. As if coming to himself out of deep brooding, he at last begins.) Wotan (very softly) If I now tell it, shall I not loosen my will\\'s o\\'ermastering hold?Brünnhilde (very softly) To Wotan\\'s will thou speakest, when thou tell\\'st what thou wilt; what am I, if not thy will alone? Wotan (very softly) What in words to none other I utter, still will remain unspoken forever: 1\\xa0speak in secret, speaking to thee. (with a muffled voice) When youthful love\\'s delight from me fled, my spirit yet longed for sway: by force of wildest wishes impelled, I won myself the world;faithless, I wrought in unknowing falseness, binding by bargains what hid mishap; craftily guided by Loge, who wandered then afar. Yet the passion of love would not loose me, in my might for love was my longing. The child of night, the craven Nibelung, Alberich, broke from its bonds; for love he foreswore and so won by his oath the glist\\'ning gold of the Rhine, and with it unmeasured might. The ring that he wrought I craftily won me, but to the Rhine gave it not again: with it I paid the price of Walhall, the home the giants had built me, wherefrom I now ruled all the world. She who doth know all things that were, Erda, the wisest holiest Wala, spoke ill redes of the ring, told of eternal disaster. (more vehement) Of the downfall I craved yet more tidings; but voiceless she vanished from sight.(with animation) Then was saddened my lightsome heart, to know then became all my need: to the womb of earth wended I my way, by love\\'s enchantment forced I the Wala, troubling her wisdom\\'s calm, and constrained her tongue to speak. Counsel I won from her words; from me yet she harbored a pledge: the world\\'s wisest of women gave me, Brünnhilde, thee. With eight sisters fostered wert thou; that ye Valkyries might forfend the doom that the Wala\\'s dark words foretold: the shameful defeat of the great ones. That foes might find us strong for the strife, heroes I bade you to bring me: the slaves we had held by our laws in bondage, the mortals whom in their might we defied, whom, enthralled by darksome, treacherous bargains, we bound in obedience blindly to serve us (becoming more animated, but with moderate power) these ever to storm and strife should ye kindle, their hearts rouse up to ruthless war, that valiant hosts of heroes should gather on Walhall\\'s height!Brünnhilde And thy halls filled we with heroes: many I brought to thee there. If we ne\\'er have failed thee, whence cometh thy fear? Wotan (with more suppressed voice) Another ill, heed thou it well! darkly the Wala foretold. Through Alberich\\'s host threatens our downfall: with envious rage burneth the Niblung, (becoming animated) but no more I dread now his dusky battalions, by my heroes safe were I held. (suppressed) Yet, if e\\'er the ring were won by the Niblung, (more suppressed) then lost were Walhall forever: for to him alone, who love forswore, is it given to use the runes of the ring to the endless shame of the gods; (becoming animated) my heroes\\' faith from me would he turn, and stir to strife my fighters themselves, and with their might give battle to me. (suppressed) Urged by fear then I thought to rob the ring from the foe-man. (suppressed) The giant Fafner, who from my hand the accursed gold as wage did win: he now guardeth the hoard for which his brother he slew. From him must I wrest the ring, that myself I gave him as guerdon. But the bond I have made, forbids me to strike him; mightless my force would fall before him: (bitterly) these are the fetters that now hold me: I, who by bargains am lord, to my bargains eke am a slave.But one may dare what to me is denied: a hero never helped by my counsel, to me unknown and free from my grace, unaware, forced by his need, without command, with his own right arm, doeth the deed that I must shun, the deed my tongue ne\\'er told, though yet my deepest desire. He, at war with the god, for me fighteth, the friendliest foe. O, how shall I find or shape me the free one, by me ne\\'er shielded, in his firm defiance the dearest to me? How fashion the Other who, not through me, but from his will for my ends shall work? O, godhead\\'s distress! Sorest disgrace! In loathing find I ever myself in all my hand has created; the Other whom I have longed for, that Other I ne\\'er shall find: himself must the free one create him; my hand nought shapeth but slaves. Brünnhilde But the Wälsung, Siegmund? works for himself? Wotan Wildly roaming with him in woodlands, ever against the gods, then his spirit I stirred: now \\'gainst the godhead\\'s vengeance guarded is he by the sword, (slowly and bitterly) that thro\\' the grace of a god was bestowed. Why would I trick myself with my cunning? So lightly my falsehood Fricka laid bare: before her glance I stood in my shame! To her will I now must yield me. Brünnhilde Then tak\\'st thou from Siegmund thy shield?Wotan When my hand touched Alberich\\'s ring, greed was mine for the gold. The curse that I fled now flies not from me: What I love best, must I surrender; slay him whom most I cherish, basely betray who in me trusts! (Wotan\\'s gestures change from the expression of terrible pain to that of despair.) Fade then away, splendor and pomp, glory of godhood\\'s glittering shame! Let fall in ruins what I have raised! Ended is my work, but one thing waits me yet: the ending, the downfall! (He pauses in thought.) And for the downfall works Alberich; now I grasp all the secret sense, that filled the words of the Wala: \"when the dusky foe of love grimly getteth a son, the doom of gods delays not long.\" Of the Niblung late a rumor I heard, that the dwarf had won a woman, by gold gaining her grace: the fruit of hate beareth a wife; the child of spite grows in her womb; this wonder befell the loveless Niblung; yet, tho\\' I loved so truly, the free one I never might win. (rising up in bitter wrath) Then take thou my blessing, Nibelung son! What I have loathed now may\\'st thou inherit; the empty pomp of the gods thy envious greed shall consume!Brünnhilde (alarmed) O say! tell me, what task must be mine? Wotan (bitterly) Fight truly for Fricka; ward for her wedlock\\'s oath! (dryly) What she doth choose, that too be my choice: what good can my will e\\'er gain me? for the free one can it not fashion: for Fricka\\'s servants fight thou alone! Brünnhilde Ah! repent thee, take back thy word! Thou lov\\'st Siegmund; knowing thy love, to serve thee, safe will I shield him. Wotan Siegmund shalt thou vanquish, and Hunding as victor shall strike! Ward thyself well, and hold thyself firm; bring all thy boldness and skill to the strife: a sure sword swings Siegmund; faint heart wilt thou not find! Brünnhilde He whom thou still hast taught me to love, who in glorious valor was ever thy dearest, for his sake now thy wavering word I defy!Wotan Ha, darest thou? Floutest thou me? Who art thou, who but the fettered, blind slave of my will? In that I have spoken, such is my shame that e\\'en thou, my creature, dost meet me with scorn? Know\\'st thou, child, my wrath? Thy spirit were crushed if on thee lighted its fierce withering flash! Within my bosom fury lies hid, that in woe and waste layeth a world that in my joy on me laughed: woe to him whom it strikes! Sad in sooth were his fate! I warn thee then, wake not my wrath! With heed fulfill my behest: Siegmund strike thou! Such be the Valkyrie\\'s task! (He storms away and quickly disappears among the rocks to the left. Brünnhilde stands for a long time confused and alarmed.) Brünnhilde Ne\\'er saw I Warfather so, though stirred to anger oft by strife. (She stoops down sadly and takes up her weapons, with which she arms herself again.) Why irks me my weapon\\'s weight? Ah, how light they lay when freely I fought! A hateful fight drags me hence today. (She gazes thoughtfully before her.) (sighing) Woe! my Wälsung! In sorest sorrow the true one must falsely forsake thee! (She turns slowly toward the back.)Scene Three (Arrived at the rocky pass, Brünnhilde, looking into the gorge, perceives Siegmund and Sieglinde: she watches them for a moment and then goes into the cavern to her horse, disappearing from the audience.) (Siegmund and Sieglinde appear on the pass. Sieglinde comes hastily forward. Siegmund tries to restrain her.) Siegmund Stay thou but here, rest thee a while! Sieglinde Farther! Farther! Siegmund (embraces her with gentle force) No farther now! (He clasps her firmly to him.) O linger, sweetest one, here! From blissfullest rapture break\\'st thou away, with frenzied haste fleeing afar: scarce could I o\\'ertake thy flight; through wood and field over rock and fell, speechless, silent flying along, my voice called thee in vain! (Sieglinde stares wildly before her.) Take now thy rest: speak but a word! End all this speechless dread! See, thy brother holdeth his bride: Siegmund\\'s heart is thy home! (She gazes with growing rapture into his eyes, then throws her arms passionately round his neck and so remains.) (She then starts up in sudden terror.) Sieglinde Away! away! fly the profaned one! Unholily holds thee my arm; disgraced, dishonored, dead is this form: cast it from thee, flee from the corpse! let winds waft her away who, graceless, herself gave to thee! When in his loving embrace,when blissful delight she found, when all his love was her own, who all her love had awaked from the holiest height of sweetest rapture, that all her soul and senses o\\'erflowed, loathing and horror, for hateful dishonor, filled with dismay the traitorous woman, who once a bridegroom obeyed, and loveless lay in his arms! Leave the accurst one, far let her flee! Dishonored am I, bereft of grace: the purest hero must I abandon to thee, the most glorious, ne\\'er may I give me. Shame would fall on the brother, scath on the rescuing friend! Siegmund Whate\\'er shame has been wrought be paid by the sinner\\'s blood! Then flee thou no farther; wait for the foe-man; fall must he before me: when Nothung\\'s point doth pierce his heart, vengeance then wilt thou have won! Sieglinde (starts up and listens) Hark! the horns call, hearest thou not? All around cries of revenge, from wood and vale, swell on our ears. Hunding has wakened from heavy sleep! Kinsmen and bloodhounds calls he together; goaded to rage, dogs are howling, loud baying to heaven, against breaking of wedlock\\'s oath! (She gazes madly before her.) Where art thou, Siegmund? still art thou here? fervently loved one, radiant brother! Let thine eyes\\' bright beams fall yet once more upon me: do not disdain the accursed woman\\'s kiss! (She throws herself sobbing on his breast: presently she starts up again in terror.) Hark! o hark! that is Hunding\\'s horn! All his pack pursue in mighty force: no sword helps thee against the hounds: let it go, Siegmund! Siegmund, where art thou? Ha, there! I see thee now! Terrible sight! Dogs are gnashing their teeth after flesh; no heed they take of the hero\\'s glance; by thy feet they seize thee with fast-holding fangs.Thou fall\\'st; in splinters the sword hath sprung: the ash-tree sinks, the stem is rent! Brother! my brother!(She sinks senseless into Siegmund\\'s arms.) Siegmund, ha! Siegmund Sister! Beloved! (He listens to her breathing and convinces himself that she still lives. He lets her slide downward so that, as he himself sinks into a sitting posture, her head rests on his lap. In this position they both remain until the end of the following scene.) (A long silence, during which Siegmund bends over Sieglinde with tender care, and presses along kiss on her brow.)Scene Four (Brünnhilde, leading her horse by the bridle, comes out of the cave and advances slowly and solemnly to the front. She pauses and observes Siegmund from a distance.) (She again slowly advances. She stops, somewhat nearer.) (She carries her shield and spear in one hand, resting the other on her horse\\'s neck, and thus, in grave silence, she watches Siegmund for some time.) Brünnhilde Siegmund! Look on me! I come to call thee hence. (Siegmund raises his eyes to her.) Siegmund Who art thou, say, who dost stand so beauteous and stern? Brünnhilde Death-doomed is he who looks upon me; who meets my glance must turn from the light of life. On the war-field alone I come to heroes; those whom I greet with me needs must go hence! (Siegmund looks long, firmly and searchingly into her eyes, then bows his head in thought and at length turns resolutely to her again.) Siegmund If death be his, whither lead\\'st thou the hero? Brünnhilde To Wotan, who casteth the lot, lead I thee: to Walhall wend with me. Siegmund On Walhall\\'s height, Wotan alone shall I find?Brünnhilde The fallen heroes\\' hallowed band shall greet thee there with high welcome and love. Siegmund Dwelleth in Walhall Wälse, the Wälsung\\'s father?Brünnhilde His father there will the Wälsung find! Siegmund (tenderly) Gladly will woman welcome me there? Brünnhilde Wish-maidens wait on thee there: Wotan\\'s daughter friendly there filleth thy cup! Siegmund Fair art thou, and holy before me stands Wotan\\'s child: yet one thing tell me, immortal! Go brother and sister to Walhall together? shall there Siegmund Sieglinde find? Brünnhilde Here on earth must she still linger: Siegmund will find not Sieglinde there. (Siegmund bends softly over Sieglinde, kisses her gently on the brow and again turns quietly to Brünnhilde.) Siegmund Then greet for me Walhall, greet for me Wotan, greet for me Wälse and all the heroes, greet too the beauteous wish-maidens: (firmly) to them I follow thee not! Brünnhilde Thou sawest the Valkyrie\\'s withering glance; with her must thou now fare!Siegmund Where Sieglinde lives in weal or woe, there will Siegmund too linger: thy withering glance served not to fright me, nor shall it e\\'er force me hence. Brünnhilde While life is thine, force were in vain; but death shall vanquish thee, fool: death-doom to bring thee I am here. Siegmund Whose hand, then, shall strike, if I must fall? Brünnhilde Hunding striketh the blow. Siegmund Bring threats more dire if thou wouldst daunt me. Lurkest thou here lusting for strife, choose thou him for thy prey: methinks he will fall in the fight! Brünnhilde Thine Wälsung, hearken to me: thine is the death decreed. Siegmund Know\\'st thou this sword? From him it came who holds me safe: through his sword thy threats I defy! Brünnhilde (with emphasis) He who bestowed it sends thee now death: for the spell he takes from the sword!Siegmund (vehemently) Still and fright not the slumberer here! (He bends tenderly, in an outburst of grief, over Sieglinde.) Woe! woe! Sweetest wife! Thou saddest among all thy faithful! \\'Gainst thy peace rages the world now in arms; and I, who alone am thy friend, for whom thou the world hast defied, may I not shield, may I not defend thee, betray thee must I in the fight? 0\\xa0shame on him who bestowed the sword and tricks me with trustless blade! If I must fall then, to Walhall I fare not: Hella hold me her own! (He bends low over Sieglinde.) Brünnhilde (moved) So lightly prizest thou bliss everlasting? (slowly and hestitatingly) All to thee is this hapless wife who, faint and care-worn, helplessly hangs in thine arms. Nought else deemst thou good? Siegmund (looking up to her bitterly) So young and fair thou shinest to me, yet how cold and hard now knows thee my heart! Canst thou but mock me, then take thyself hence, thou cruel, merciless maid! Or if thou dost hunger for my distress, then freely feast on my woe; let my grief quicken thy envious heart: but of Walhall\\'s loveless raptures speak not, prithee, to me!Brünnhilde I see the distress that doth gnaw at thy heart, 1\\xa0feel all the hero\\'s holiest grief! Siegmund, to me give thy wife, let her safeguard be my shield! Siegmund No other than I, while she lives, shall safeguard the pure one; if death be my doom, I will slay the slumberer here! Brünnhilde (with increasing emotion) Wälsung! Madman! Hearken to me! to me trust thy wife, for the pledge\\'s sake, that in rapture from thee she received.Siegmund (drawing his sword) This sword, though by traitor to true man decreed; this sword, that fails me in face of my foe: serves it not then against foe, right well it shall serve against friend! (He points the sword at Sieglinde.) Two lives now laugh to thee here: take them, Nothung, envious steel! take them with one fell stroke!Brünnhilde (in a passionate outburst of sympathy) Forbear! Wälsung! Hearken to me! Sieglind\\' shall live then, and, Siegmund, live thou with her! \\'Tis thus decreed; recalled the death-doom: thine, Siegmund, thine be triumph and bliss! Hear\\'st thou the call? Prepare thyself now! Trust to the sword, and strike without fear: sure striketh the blade, as the Valkyrie\\'s shield is sure! Farewell, Siegmund, hero most blest! On the field once more shall I find thee! (She rushes away, and disappears with her horse in a ravine on the right. Siegmund looks after her with joy and exultation.) (The stage has gradually darkened; heavy storm clouds sink down and cover the background, grad- ually veiling the cliffs, ravine and rocky pass completely from view.)Scene Five (Siegmund again bends over Sieglinde, listening to her breathing.) Siegmund Slumber charms with soothing spell the fair one\\'s pain and grief. When the Valkyrie hither came, brought she then this blissful repose? Should not the furious fight wake fear in her sorrowing heart? Lifeless seems she who yet hath life: her sorrow is soothed by a smiling dream. So slumber still on till the fight be fought, and peace to thee bring joy! (He lays her gently on the rocky seat and kisses her forehead as farewell.) (He hears Hunding\\'s horn-call and starts up with resolution) Thou who dost call, arm thyself now; whate\\'er is due take thou here: (He draws his sword.) Nothung payeth the debt! (He hastens to the background and, on reaching the pass, disappears in the dark storm cloud, from which a flash of lightning immediately breaks.) Sieglinde (begins to move restlessly in her dreams) Would now but father come home! With the boy he still roams in the woods. Mother! Mother! I quake with fear, with eyes unfriendly glower the strangers! Misty darkness fills all the air ... fiery tongues are flaming around ... they burn the house . o, help us, brother! Siegmund! Siegmund! (She springs up.) (Violent thunder and lightning.) Siegmund! Ha! (She stares about her in growing terror: nearly the whole of the stage is veiled with black thunderclouds. Hunding\\'s horn-call sounds near.)Hunding (in the background, from the mountain pass) Wehwalt! Wehwalt! Stand there and fight, else with the hounds must I hold thee. Siegmund (from farther off in the ravine) Where hidest thou, that I can find thee not? Stand, that I may face thee! Sieglinde (listening in fearful terror) Hunding! Siegmund! Could I but see them! Hunding Fly not, thou traitorous wooer! Fricka striketh thee here! Siegmund (now likewise from the pass) Still ween\\'st thou me weaponless, craven wight? Threat not with women, thyself do battle, lest Fricka fail thee at last! For see! from thy house-tree\\'s blossoming stem, I drew undaunted the sword; and its edge right soon shalt thou taste! (A flash of lightning illuminates the rock for an instant, during which Hunding and Siegmund are seen in mortal combat.) Sieglinde (with her utmost force) Hold your hands, ye madmen! murder me first! (She rushes toward the pass: but suddenly, from above the combatants on the right, a flash breaks forth so vividly that she staggers aside as if blinded.)Brünnhilde Strike him, Siegmund! trust to the sword! (In the glare of light Brünnhilde appears, floating above Siegmund, and protecting him with her shield. Just as Siegmund aims a deadly blow at Hunding, a glowing red light breaks from the left through the clouds, in which Wotan appears, standing over Hunding, holding his spear across in front of Siegmund.) Wotan Go back from the spear! In splinters the sword! (Brünnhilde, in terror before Wotan, sinks back with her shield: Siegmund\\'s sword snaps on the outstretched spear. Hunding plunges his spear into the disarmed Siegmund\\'s breast. Siegmund falls dead to the ground: Sieglinde, who has heard his death-sigh, falls with a cry, as if lifeless, to earth.) (With Siegmund\\'s fall the two lights disappear; dark clouds cover all but the foreground; through them Brünnhilde is indistinctly seen, as she turns in haste to Sieglinde.) Brünnhilde To horse! that I may save thee! (She lifts Sieglinde quickly onto her horse, which is standing near the side gorge, and immediately dis- appears with her.) (At this moment the clouds divide in the middle, so that Hunding, who has just drawn his spear from the fallen Siegmund\\'s breast, is clearly seen.) (Wotan, surrounded by clouds, stands on a rock behind, leaning on his spear and sadly gazing on Siegmund\\'s body.)Wotan (to Hunding) Go hence, slave! Kneel before Fricka: tell her that Wotan\\'s spear avenged what wrought her wrong. Go! Go! (Before the contemptuous wave of Wotan\\'s hand, Hunding sinks dead to the ground. (suddenly breaking out in terrible rage) But Brünnhilde! Woe to the guilty one! Dire wage shall she win for her crime, if my steed o\\'ertake her in flight! (He disappears with thunder and lightning. The curtain falls quickly.)Act Three Scene One (The curtain rises. On the summit of a rocky mountain. On the right a pinewood encloses the stage. On the left is the entrance to a cave; above this the rock rises to its highest point. At the back the view is entirely open; rocks of various heights form a parapet to the precipice.) (Occasionally clouds fly past the mountain peak, as if driven by storm. Gerhilde, Ortlinde, Waltraute and Schwert leite have ensconced themselves on the rocky peak above the cave: they are in full armor.) Gerhilde (on the highest point, calling toward the background, where a thick cloud passes) Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Heiaha! Helmwige! Here! Guide hither thy horse! Helmwige (at the back, offstage) Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Heiaha! (A flash of lightning breaks through a passing cloud: in the light a Valkyrie on horseback becomes visible: on her saddle hangs a slain warrior. The apparition, approach ing the rocky cliff, passes from left to right.)Gerhilde, Waltraute, Schwertleite (all three calling to her as she approaches) Heiaha! Heiaha! (The cloud with the apparition disappears to the right behind the wood.) Ortlinde (calling toward the wood) By Ortlinde\\'s filly fasten thy horse: gladly my grey will graze near thy chestnut! Waltraute (calling toward the wood) Who hangs at thy saddle? Helmwige (coming from the wood) Sintolt, the Hegeling! Schwertleite Far from the grey, then, fasten thy chestnut: Ortlinde\\'s filly bears Witting, the Irming! Gerhilde (coming down lower) For foes have been ever Sintolt and Wittig! Ortlinde (starts up) Heiaha! Heiaha! The horse attacketh my mare! (She runs to the wood.)Helm., Ger., Schw. (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Gerhilde The heroes\\' strife makes foes of the horses! Helwige (call back into the wood) Quiet, Brownie! break not the peace, now. Waltraute (on the topmost point, where she has taken Gerhilde\\'s post as watcher) Hoioho! Hoioho! (calling toward the right-hand side of the background) Siegrune here! Where sta/ st thou so long? (She listens toward the right.) Siegrune (offstage, from the back on the right) Work to do! Are the others all here? Schwertleite (calling toward the right-hand side of the background) Hojotoho! Waltraute (the same) Hojotoho! Gerhilde (the same) Heiaha!Waltraute, Schwertleite Heiaha! (Their gestures, as well as a bright light behind the wood, show that Siegrune has just arrived there.) Grimgerde (from the back on the left, offstage) Hojotoho! Rossweisse (from the same place, offstage) Hojotoho! Grimgerde, Rossweisse Heiaha! Waltraute (toward the left) Grimgerd\\' and Rossweisse! Gerhilde (the same) Together they ride. (In a bank of clouds, passing from the left, Ross- weisse and Grimgerde appear, illumined by a flash of lightning. Both are on horseback, and each carries a slain warrior on her saddle. Helmwige, Ortlinde and Siegrune have come out of the wood and wave to the approaching Rossweisse and Grimgerde from the edge of the precipice.) Helm., Ort., Siegr. We greet you travelers! Rossweiss\\' and Grimgerde! Rossweisse, Grimgerde (offstage) Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Heiaha! (The apparition disappears behind the wood.)The other six Valkyries Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Heiaha! Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Heiaha! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Heiaha! Heiaha! Gerhilde (calling into the wood) Leave there in the forest your steeds to graze! Ortlinde (likewise calling into the wood) Lead off the mares afar from each other, till all our heroes\\' anger is calmed! Waltraute, Schwertleite (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Gerhilde, Siegrune (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Helmwige The grey has paid for the heroes\\' anger! Wal., Schw., Helm., Ger. (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ortlinde, Siegrune (laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Rossweisse, Grimgerde (coming out of the wood) Hojotoho! Hojotoho!The other six Valkyries Be welcome! Be welcome! The eight Valkyries Be welcome! Schwertleite Rode ye valiant ones paired? Grimgerde Apart journeyed we, and met but today. Rossweisse Are we all then assembled? then stay no longer: to Walhall wend we our way; Wotan awaiteth the slain. Helmwige Are we but eight? wanting is one. Gerhilde By the brown-eyed Wälsung lingers yet Brünnhild\\'. Waltraute Till she comes hither still must we stay: greeting full grim would Warfather give, if without her we should come. Siegrune (on the lookout) Hojotoho! Hojotoho! (calling toward the back) Hallo! Hallo! (to the others) In furious haste there Brünnhilde flies. (All hasten to the lookout.)The eight Valkyries Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Heiaha! Brünnhilde, hei! (They watch with growing astonishment.) Waltraute To the wood guides she her staggering horse. Grimgerde From fierce riding how Grane pants! Rossweisse So fast none e\\'er saw Valkyrie flying! Ortlinde What lies on her saddle? Helmwige That is no man! Siegrune See, a maid bears she. Gerhilde Where found she the maid? Schwertleite With ne\\'er a sign greets she the sisters! Waltraute (calling down, very loudly) Heiaha! Brünnhilde! hearest thou not? Ortlinde Hasten ye from her horse to help her!Helmwige, Gerhilde (both running toward the wood) Hojotoho! Hojotoho! Siegrune, Rossweisse (running after them) Hojotoho! Hojotoho! The other four Valkyries Heiaha! Heiaha! Waltraute (looking into the wood) To earth sinks down Grane the strong one! Grimgerde From the saddle swiftly swings she the maid! (All run toward the wood.) Ort., Wal., Grim., Schw. Sister! sister! What has befall\\'n? (All the Valkyries come back to the stage: with them comes Brünnhilde, supporting and leading Sieglinde.) Brünnhilde (out of breath) Shield me and help in direst need! Grim., Siegr., Ger., Helm. Whence rodest thou hither? why in such haste? Ortl., Wal., Ross., Schw. So ride those only who flee! Siegrune Art thou pursued? Brünnhilde I flee for the first time, and am pursued: Warfather follows close! (All the Valkyries violently alarmed.)Helm., Ger., Siegr., Grim. Lost are thy senses? Speak to us! What? Fleest thou from him? Ort., Wal., Roß., Schw. Ha! Speak! Pursues thee Warfather? O say! Brünnhilde (turns anxiously to look out and then comes back) O sisters, look from the rocky summit! Look to northward if Warfather nears? (Ortlinde and Waltraute spring up to watch from the rocky peak.) Brünnhilde Speak! Tell what ye see! Ortlinde A thunderstorm nears from northward. Waltraute Gathering clouds range themselves here! The other six Valkyries Warfather rideth his sacred steed! Brünnhilde The wild pursuer who hunts me in wrath, he nears, he nears from northward! Shield me, sisters! Shelter this wife! Six Valkyries What aileth the woman?Brünnhilde Hear me then quickly: Sieglinde is she, Siegmund\\'s sister and bride: \\'gainst all the Wälsungs doth Wotan angrily rage; to strike the brother dead in the fight was Brünnhilde\\'s task; but Siegmund held I safe with my shield: Wotan in wrath then struck him himself with his spear: Siegmund fell; but I fled forth with the wife; and to save her flew I to you that in danger (in fear) ye might hide me from the threatening blow! Six Valkyries (in great consternation) What madness urged thee this deed to do? Lost one! Brünnhilde, lost one! Helm., Siegr., Grim. Brok\\'st thou, rebellious Brünnhilde, Warfather\\'s holy behest? Ger., Ross., Schw. Brok\\'st thou Warfather\\'s holy behest? Waltraute (on the lookout) Darkness comes from the north like the night. Ortlinde (on the lookout) Raging steereth hither the storm.Ross., Grim., Schw. Loud neigheth Warfather\\'s steed! Helm., Ger., Schw. Panting hither it flies. Brünnhilde Woe to the wife if the god find her here: for all of the Wälsungs dooms he to downfall! O say, who will lend the trustiest horse, to save the wife from his wrath? Siegrune Wouldst lead us his rage to defy? Brünnhilde Rossweisse, sister, lend me but thy courser! Rossweisse From Warfather ne\\'er yet fled he in fear. Brünnhilde Helwige, hear me! Helmwige I brave not our father. Brünnhilde Grimgerde! Gerhilde! Grant me a horse! Schwertleite! Siegrune! See my dismay! True be to me, as I have been true: save now this sorrowing wife! (Sieglinde, who has hitherto stared gloomily and coldly before her, starts up with a repellent gesture as Brünnhilde embraces her warmly, as if to protect her.)Sieglinde Let sorrow not vex thee for me: only death is my due. Who bade thee bear me, maid, from the battle? Perchance my death-stroke I there had won from the very weapon that dealt his death; in life\\'s last moment made one with him! Far from Siegmund. Siegmund, from thee! O shelter me, death, from remembrance! Lest for thy help my curse should requite thee, now hearken, maid, to my prayer: thrust thou thy sword into my heart! Brünnhilde Live still, o woman, for love doth call thee! Rescue the pledge that from him thou hast won: (forcibly and urgently) a Wälsung\\'s life thou dost bear! (Sieglinde starts violently: suddenly her face glows with sublime joy.) Sieglinde Rescue me, brave one! Rescue my child! Guard me, ye maidens, with mighty defence! (An ever-darkening thunderstorm approaches from the back.)Waltraute (on the lookout) The storm cometh near! Ortlinde (on the lookout) Fly, all who fear it! The other six Valkyries Hence with the woman! danger is here: the Valkyries\\' shelter dare we not give! Sieglinde (on her knees before Brünnhilde) Rescue me, maid! rescue the mother! Brünnhilde (raises Sieglinde with sudden determination) Away, then, fly swiftly, and fly thou alone! I stay in thy stead, draw on me Wotan\\'s anger, by me holding the wrathful one here, whilst thou from his vengeance escap\\'st. Sieglinde Say, whither shall I turn me? Brünnhilde Which of you, sisters, journeyed to eastward? Siegrune A forest wild spreads far to the east: the Nibelung\\'s hoard by Fafner thither was borne. Schwertleite There as a dread dragon he dwelleth, and in a cave there guardeth he Alberich\\'s ring!Grimgerde For a helpless woman no home were there. Brünnhilde And yet from Wotan\\'s wrath shelter safe were the wood: our father feareth and shunneth the place. Waltraute (on the lookout) Raging rides the god to the rock! Six Valkyries Brünnhilde, hear how he nears like a storm! Brünnhilde (urgently) Fly then swiftly and turn to the east! Bold in defiance endure ev ry ill, hunger and thirst, thorns and rough ways; laugh whether want or suffering wound! For one thing know and hold it ever: the world\\'s most glorious hero bears, o woman, thy sheltering womb! (She takes the pieces of Sigmund\\'s sword from under her breastplate and gives them to Sieglinde.) For him ward thou well the mighty splinters; from his father\\'s death-field by good hap I saved them: who once shall swing the sword new wrought, his name from me let him take— Siegfried in triumph shall live!Sieglinde (deeply moved) O radiant wonder! Glorious maid! Thou bring\\'st me, true one, holiest balm! For him whom we loved I save the beloved one: may my thanks yet bring laughing reward! Fare thou well! be blest in Sieglinde\\'s woe! (She hastens away on the right in front.) (Black thunderclouds surround the height; a fearful storm approaches from the back: a growing fiery light on the right.) Wotan (offstage) Stay, Brünnhild\\'! Ortlinde, Waltraute (coming down from the lookout) The rock is reached by horse and rider! (Brünnhilde, after watching Sieglinde for a while, turns toward the background, looks into the wood, and comes forward again in fear.) All eight Valkyries Woe, Brünnhild\\'! raging he comes! Brünnhilde Ah, sisters, help! my heart is faint! His wrath will crush me, if ye no shelter can give. (The Valkyries retreat up the rocky point in fear; Brünnhilde lets herself be drawn with them.) The Valkyries Then hide, thou lost one! Be thou not seen, hide thee in our midst, and heed not his call! Be hid by us! (They hide Brünnhilde among them and look anxiously toward the wood, which is now lit up by brilliant firelight, while the background has become quite dark.) Woe! Wotan swings him raging to earth! Hither haste his steps for revenge.Scene Two (Wotan strides in terrible wrathful excitement from the wood and approaches the group of Valkyries on the height, looking angrily around for Brünnhilde.) Wotan Where is Brünnhild\\', where the rebellious one? Would ye then dare to shield her from vengeance? The eight Valkyries Fearful thy fury soundeth! O father, what did thy children, that they have wakened thy terrible wrath? Wotan Would ye then mock me? Heed yourselves, rash ones! I know, Brünnhilde hide ye from me. Turn ye from her! cast off is she henceforth, e\\'en as her worth from her she cast! Rossweisse To us fled the pursued one, Siegr., Ross., Grim., Schw. For our help prayed she to us; Waltraute Thy rage awoke her fear and dismay: Siegrune Fear and trembling seize the pursued one! Schwertleite, Grimgerde Thy rage awakened her fear and shrinking, for our sister pray we to thee!Ortlinde Father, hear our prayer! Rossweisse, Waltraute For our trembling sister pray we to thee that thy passion\\'s rage may be calmed! Ger., Helm., Ort. Soften thine anger! Siegrune Calm now thy passion\\'s rage! Helmwige For her, calm thy passion\\'s rage! Wotan Weak-hearted and womanish brood! Such sorry valor won ye from me? I fostered you bold to fare to the field, hard and relentless your hearts I wrought, and ye wild ones now weep and whine, when my wrath on a traitor doth fall? Then know, ye trembling ones, what was her crime for whom your tears now in pity are shed: No one but she knew what lay hid in my bosom; no one but she saw to the spring of my spirit! In her deeds my desires were born to the day: our holy bond she hath now so disdained that, faithless, she my own will hath defied, my sacred command openly scorned, against me she lifted the spear that by Wotan\\'s will she bore! Hear\\'st thou, Brünnhilde? Thou on whom birny, helm and spear, name and renown, life and delight I bestowed?Hear\\'st thou my voice upraised, and shrinking hid\\'st thee from me, that thou may\\'st escape thy doom? (Brünnhilde comes forward out of the band of the Valkyries and moves with humble but firm steps down the rock, to within a short distance from Wotan.) Brünnhilde Here am I, father: pronounce now my sentence! Wotan I sentence thee not: thou thyself thy sentence hast shaped. My will alone awoke thee to life: yet against my will hast thou worked; thine \\'twas alone to fulfill my commands: yet against me hast thou commanded; wish-maid thou wert to me: against me thy wish has been turned; shield-maid thou wert to me: against me thy shield was upraised; lot-chooser thou wert to me: against me the lot hast thou chosen; hero-stirrer thou wert to me: against me thou stirredst up heroes. What once thou wert, Wotan hath spoken: what now thou art, say thou to thyself! Wish-maid art thou no more; Valkyrie once wert thou called: what now thou art, henceforth shalt thou be! Brünnhilde (violently terrified) Thou dost cast me off? What meaneth thy word?Wotan No more shall I send thee from Walhall; to war-field no more far\\'st thou on quest; no more bring\\'st thou heroes to fill my halls: at the godhead\\'s festal banquet the drink-horn for me thou fillest no more; thy childlike mouth no more shall I kiss; the heavenly host no more shall know thee; outcast art thou from the clan of the gods: for broken now is our bond, henceforth from sight of my face art thou banned. (The Valkyries, in great excitement, come a little further down the rocks.) The Valkyries Horror! Woe! Sister, oh sister! Brünnhilde All thou once gavest thou tak\\'st away?Wotan He who wins robs thee of all! For here on the rock bound shalt thou be; defenceless in sleep liest thou locked: the man shall master the maid who shall find her and wake her from sleep. (In the greatest emotion the Valkyries quite de- scend from the rock and in anxious groups surround Brünn hilde, who lies half kneeling before Wotan.) Waltraute Repent! repent! O Father! shall the maiden pale and be withered by man? Ah, deal not this shame! Ah, deal not this crying disgrace! deal not this shame, ah, deal not, Father, this disgrace, ah, deal not, deal not this shame, for our sister\\'s shame on us would fall; Ortlinde O Father! repent! Repent! hear now our prayer! O bring not on her this crying disgrace! God, in thy wrath, deal not this shame, deal it not! Ah, bring not, bring not disgrace on her, on us her disgrace would fall; Grimgerde O Father! Shall the maiden pale and be withered by man? Bring not on her this crying disgrace! Give ear to us! Dread-Father, o bring not, o bring not, ah, bring not on her this crying disgrace, deal not this shame! For our sister\\'s shame on us too would fall, should the holiest maiden pale and be withered by man;Schwertleite O Father! Shall the maiden pale and be withered by man? Shall the maiden pale and be withered? Ah, deal not this disgrace! Ah, bring thou not, Father, ah, bring not, ah, bring not on her this crying disgrace, ah, deal not this shame! Ah, deal not, deal not this shame! On us her shame would fall; Helmwige Recall the curse! Repent! hear now our prayer! Bring not on her this crying disgrace! God, in thy wrath, bring not on her this crying disgrace! For our sister\\'s shame on us would fall;Gerhilde Recall the curse! O Father! Shall the maiden pale and be withered by man? O deal thou not, God, in thy wrath, deal not this shame, deal thou not, ah, deal not this shame! For our sister\\'s shame falleth on us, should the holiest maiden pale and be withered by man; Siegrune Recall the curse! Shall the maiden pale and be withered by man? Bring not on her this crying disgrace! Dread-Father, bring not on her this crying disgrace, ah, deal not this shame! For our sister\\'s shame on us too would fall, should the holiest maiden pale and be withered by man; Rossweisse Recall the curse! Shall the maiden pale and be withered by man? Hard-hearted father! deal not this shame! Dread-Father, bring not, ah, bring not this crying disgrace on her, ah, deal not, deal not this shame! Our sister\\'s shame on us would fall;All the Valkyries For our sister\\'s shame on us too would fall! Wotan Have ye not heard Wotan\\'s decree? From out your troop must your traitorous sister be banished; as once she rode through the clouds with you rides she no longer; her maidenhood\\'s flower will fade away; a husband will gain all her womanly grace: the will of her master she now shall obey, by the hearth at home shall she spin, to all mockers a mark for scorn! (Brünnhilde sinks with a cry on the ground; the Valkyries, horror-struck, recoil violently from her.) Frights you her lot? Then fly from the lost one! Wend ye from her and bide ye afar! If one should venture near her to linger, in my despite befriending her fate; that rash one shareth her lot: then heed ye right well my word! Hence now away; hither return not! Swiftly ride from the mountain, lest ill-fate light on you here! (The Valkyries separate with a wild cry and rush in hasty flight to the wood.)The Valkyries Woe! Woe! (Black clouds settle thickly on the cliffs: a rushing sound is heard in the wood. A vivid flash of lightning breaks from the clouds; in it the Valkyries, in a closely packed group, are seen with their bridles loose, wildly riding away.) (The storm soon subsides; the thunderclouds grad- ually disappear. During the following scene twilight falls with returning fine weather, followed at the close by the night.)Scene Three (Wotan and Brünnhilde, who lies at his feet, remain alone. A long, solemn silence: positions unchanged.) (She begins slowly to raise her head a little.) Brünnhilde (beginning timidly and becoming firmer) Was my offense so laden with shame that the offender so shamefully is scourged? Was there such deep disgrace in my deed that I so deeply must sink in disgrace? Was then my crime so dark with dishonor, that it robs me of honor for aye? (She raises herself gradually to a kneeling position.) O say: Father! look in my eyes: silence thy wrath, soften thy rage, and shew to me clear the hidden guilt, that in cruel anger doth force thee to cast off the child of thy heart. Wotan (in unchanged attitude, gravely and gloomily) Ask of thy deed, and that will shew thee thy guilt! Brünnhilde By thy command only I fought. Wotan By my command didst thou fight for the Wälsung? Brünnhilde So didst thou decree as lord of the lots!Wotan But my decree thou knew\\' st again I recalled! Brünnhilde As Fricka ensnared thy will to her service; when thou wert forced to befriend her, foe wert thou to thyself. Wotan (softly and bitterly) That thou understood\\'st me, weened I, and chided thy insolent thought: but coward and fool deemedst thou me! So had I not treason to punish, all too mean wert thou for my wrath. Brünnhilde No wisdom have I, yet knew I this one thing, that the Wälsung thou lovedst. I knew all the strife, forcing thy will, that drove that love from remembrance. The other only couldst thou discern, which, so sad to sight, prayed on thy heart that Siegmund might not be shielded. Wotan Then knewest thou that, and nathless gave him thy shield?Brünnhilde (beginning softly) As for thee I held but the one in my eyes, when entrammeled wert thou by twofold desire, blindly thy back on him turning! She who in the field wards thy back from the foe, she saw now only what thou saw\\'st not: Siegmund I beheld. Death-doom I brought to him there; I looked in his eyes, heard his lament; I discerned the hero\\'s bitter distress; loudly resounded the plaint of the bold one: unbounded love\\'s most hopeless despair, saddest heart\\'s most dauntless disdain! My ears have heard, my eyes have seen what, deep in my bosom, with awe and trembling filled all my heart. Dazed and shrinking stood I in shame. How I might serve him must I bethink me: (with animation) triumph or death to share with Siegmund: that seemed only the lot I could choose! He who this love into my heart had breathed, whose will had placed the Wälsung at my side, true only to him, thy word did I defy. Wotan So thou hast done what so dearly I had desired, yet by twofold fateto my will was denied! So light deemedst thou winning of hearts\\' deepest rapture, when burning woe in my heart outbroke, when anguish awoke the grim intent, for the world I loved so, the spring of love in my tortured heart to imprison? When \\'gainst my own self in my torment I turned me, from weakness\\' pangs I rose up in frenzy, furious yearning\\'s fiercest desire the fearful design in me wrought, in the wreck of my ruined world my unending sorrow to bury: then thou wert lapped in blissful delights; filled with emotion\\'s rapturous joy, thou drankest laughing the draught of love; with mine, gall of the god\\'s bitterest bondage was mixed.(dryly and shortly) Now thy lightsome heart henceforth shall lead thee: from me hast thou turned away. Aye must I shun thee; together no more may we e\\'er whisper counsel; henceforth our paths are parted forever, for while life shall endure, may the god ne\\'er give thee his greeting! Brünnhilde (simply) Unfit was for thee this foolish maid, who, stunned by thy counsel, nought understood, when but one command her own counsel made clear: to love all that thou hadst loved. Must I then leave thee and, fearing, shun thee, must thou loosen our fast-woven bond, and half thy being far from thee banish, who once belonged to thee only, thou god, forget not that! Thy other self thou wilt not dishonor, deal not disgrace that will shame thee too! Thy own fame would be darkened, were I the plaything of scorn! Wotan The might of love thou hast followed fain: follow now him who shall force thy love. Brünnhilde Must I then go from Walhall, no more to have part in thy working, a man as my master henceforth must I serve: to boastful craven make me not thrall, not all unworthy be he who wins!Wotan From Warfather turnedst thou; he may not fashion thy fate. Brünnhilde (softly and confidentially) From thee rose a glorious race; that race ne\\'er shall bring forth a craven: the bravest of heroes, I know it, shall bless the Wälsungs\\' line. Wotan Name not the Wälsungs to me! When thee I cast off, cast off were they; by envy wrecked was the race! Brünnhilde She who turned from thee rescued the race. (secretly) Sieglinde bears the holiest fruit; (with animation) in pain and grief such as woman ne\\'er suffered will she bring forth what in fear she hides! Wotan Ne\\'er seek at my hand shelter for her, or for fruit her womb shall bear. Brünnhilde (secretly) She guardeth the sword that thou gavest Siegmund. Wotan (vehemently) The sword that I in splinters struck! Seek not, o maid, to vanquish my spirit, await now thy fate, as it must fall; I cannot change it for thee. But hence must I now, far from thee fare; too long I stay with thee here: as from me turnedst thou, turn I from thee; what wish is thine I may not e\\'en know: the sentence now must I see fulfilled!Brünnhilde What hast thou decreed that I shall suffer? Wotan In slumber fast shalt thou be locked: who so the helpless one finds; and wakes, shall win thee for wife! Brünnhilde (falls on her knees) If fetters of sleep fast shall bind me, for basest craven an easy booty; this one thing must thou grant me, in deepest anguish I pray: o shelter me sleeping with scaring horrors, (firmly) that but the first, most fearless of heroes e\\'er may find me here on the fell! Wotan Too much thou cravest, too great a grace! Brünnhilde (embracing his knees) This one thing must thou grant me! O crush thou thy child who clasps thy knee; tread down thy dear one, destroy the maid, let thy spear put out the light of her life: but cast not, in thy wrath, on her this most hateful shame! (with wild ecstasy) By thy command enkindle a fire; with flaming guardians girdle the fell; to lick with tongue, to bite with tooth the craven, who rashly dareth to draw near the threatening rock! (Wotan, overcome and deeply moved, turns eagerly toward Brünnhilde, raises her from her knees and gazes with emotion into her eyes.)Wotan Farewell, thou valiant, glorious child! Thou once the holiest pride of my heart! Farewell! farewell! farewell! (very passionately) Must I forsake thee, and may my welcome of love no more greet thee; may\\'st thou now ne\\'er more ride as my comrade, nor bear me mead at banquet; must I abandon thee, whom I loved so, thou laughing delight of my eyes? Such a bridal fire for thee shall be kindled as ne\\'er yet has burned for a bride! Threatening flames shall flare round the fell: let withering terrors daunt the craven! let cowards fly from Brünnhilde\\'s rock! For one alone winneth the bride; one freer than I, the god! (Brünnhilde, deeply moved, sinks in ecstasy on Wotan\\'s breast: he holds her in a long embrace.) (She throws her head back again and, still embracing Wotan, gazes with deep enthusiasm in his eyes.) Thy brightly glittering eyes, that, smiling, oft I caressed, when valor won a kiss as guerdon, when childish lispings of heroes\\' praise from sweetest lips has flowed forth: those gleaming radiant eyes that oft in storms on me shone, when hopeless yearning my heart had wasted, when world\\'s delights all my wishes wakened, thro\\' wild wildering sadness:once more today, lured by their light, my lips shall give them love\\'s farewell! On mortal more blessed once may they beam: on me, hapless immortal, must they close now forever. (He clasps her head in his hands.) For so turns the god now from thee, so kisses thy godhood away! (He kisses her long on the eyes. She sinks back with closed eyes, unconscious, in his arms. He gently bears her to a low mossy mound, which is overshadowed by a wide-spreading fir tree, and lays her upon it.) (He looks upon her and closes her helmet: his eyes then rest on the form of the sleeper, which he now completely covers with the great steel shield of the Valkyrie. He turns slowly away, then again turns around with a sorrowful look.) (He strides with solemn decision to the middle of the stage and directs the point of his spear toward a large rock.) Loge, hear! List to my word! As I found thee of old, a glimmering flame, as from me thou didst vanish, in wandering fire; as once I stayed thee, stir I thee now! Appear! come, waving fire, and wind thee in flames round the fell! (During the following he strikes the rock thrice with his spear.) Loge! Loge! appear! (A flash of flame issues from the rock, which swells to an ever-brightening fiery glow.) (Flickering flames break forth.) (Bright shooting flames surround Wotan. With his spear he directs the sea of fire to encircle the rocks; it presently spreads toward the background, where it encloses the mountain in flames.) He who my spearpoint\\'s sharpness feareth shall cross not the flaming fire! (He stretches out the spear as a spell. He gazes sorrowfully back on Brünnhilde. Slowly he turns to depart. He turns his head again and looks back. He diasappears through the fire.)
